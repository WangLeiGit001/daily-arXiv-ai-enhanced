Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DD-MDN是一个端到端的概率人类轨迹预测模型，通过结合去噪扩散和双混合密度网络实现高精度位置预测、校准不确定性和短观察鲁棒性，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: DD-MDN模型成功解决了人类轨迹预测中不确定性建模和短观察鲁棒性的关键问题，为下游应用提供了更可靠的预测结果。

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

TL;DR: ABot-M0是一个通用机器人智能框架，通过统一数据预处理、动作流形学习和模块化感知，解决了多硬件平台机器人智能开发中的数据碎片化、表示不一致和训练目标不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人领域'一个大脑，多种形态'范式中的核心挑战：碎片化数据、不一致表示和不对齐的训练目标，构建跨硬件平台的通用具身智能体。

Method: 1) 构建系统化数据整理流程，从6个公共数据集创建UniACT数据集（600万轨迹，9500小时数据）；2) 提出动作流形假设，使用DiT骨干网络进行动作流形学习；3) 采用双流机制实现模块化感知，集成VLM语义与几何先验。

Conclusion: ABot-M0框架通过系统性方法解决了机器人智能开发的关键挑战，支持端到端的异构数据转换和统一表示学习，为通用具身智能的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

### [3] [Toward Reliable Tea Leaf Disease Diagnosis Using Deep Learning Model: Enhancing Robustness With Explainable AI and Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11239)
*Samanta Ghosh,Jannatul Adan Mahi,Shayan Abrar,Md Parvez Mia,Asaduzzaman Rayhan,Abdul Awal Yasir,Asaduzzaman Hridoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于深度学习的高效茶叶病害自动分类系统，使用TeaLeafBD数据集（5278张高分辨率图像），通过对抗训练和数据增强提高模型鲁棒性，EfficientNetB3达到93%的最高分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 茶叶是孟加拉国的重要经济作物，但叶片病害严重影响产量和质量。手动检测病害耗时且容易出错，需要开发自动化检测方案来提升农业管理效率。

Method: 采用DenseNet201和EfficientNetB3深度学习模型，包含数据预处理、数据分割、对抗训练、数据增强等流程，并使用Grad-CAM可视化技术分析模型决策依据。

Result: EfficientNetB3模型获得93%的分类准确率，DenseNet201达到91%，证明该方法能有效识别7类茶叶叶片状态（6种病害+健康叶片）。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习管道能够准确检测茶叶叶片病害，为现代农业管理提供了实用的自动化解决方案，对抗训练使模型在噪声干扰下仍能有效工作。

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero是一个主动探索视觉环境的自演框架，通过搜索器、提问器和求解器三个协同进化的智能体，实现自主构建学习轨迹的自适应视觉语言模型训练，在12个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的自演方法依赖静态图像集的被动交互，导致对初始数据集的强依赖和学习效率低下，无法根据能力演变主动寻找合适的视觉数据。

Method: 提出Active-Zero框架，包含三个协同进化智能体：搜索器从开放世界库中基于模型能力边界检索图像，提问器合成校准的推理任务，求解器通过准确度奖励进行精炼，形成闭环自搭建课程。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型上，推理任务平均准确率达到53.97%（提升5.7%），通用理解任务达到59.77%（提升3.9%），在所有基准测试中均优于现有自演基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动探索是实现可扩展和自适应自进化视觉语言系统的关键要素，Active-Zero框架有效解决了被动交互方法的局限性，为视觉语言模型的自主进化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

### [5] [ReTracing: An Archaeological Approach Through Body, Machine, and Generative Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11242)
*Yitong Wang,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing是一个多智能体具身表演艺术项目，采用考古学方法研究AI如何塑造、限制和产生身体动作。通过科幻小说提取人机交互描述，使用LLM生成动作指令对，扩散模型转换为人类表演者和机器人的编舞指导，在镜面地板上表演并记录运动轨迹，揭示生成系统中的社会文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人工智能如何通过编排动作编码社会文化偏见，探索在AI也能移动、思考和留下痕迹的时代，作为人类意味着什么的深刻问题。

Method: 1)从科幻小说提取人机交互描述句子；2)使用大语言模型生成"做什么"和"不做什么"的配对提示；3)通过扩散式文本到视频模型转换为编舞指导；4)人类表演者和四足机器人同时在镜面地板上表演；5)多摄像头运动跟踪并重建为3D点云和运动轨迹。

Conclusion: ReTracing提供了一种新颖的方法来揭示技术系统中的文化编码，通过具身表演艺术的形式探讨了人工智能时代的人类身份和存在意义问题。

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEAL基准测试揭示当前视频-语言模型在理解视频内容、时序和运动方面存在严重缺陷，通过五项压力测试发现模型存在时序期望偏差、语言捷径依赖、视频附和性、相机运动敏感性和时空遮挡鲁棒性差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频-语言模型是否能够稳健地处理视频内容、时序序列和运动信息，发现现有模型在这些基础能力上存在系统性缺陷。

Method: 开发REVEAL诊断基准，包含五项控制性压力测试：时序期望偏差测试、语言捷径依赖测试、视频附和性测试、相机运动敏感性测试和时空遮挡鲁棒性测试，使用自动化数据管道生成诊断样本。

Result: 主流开源和闭源视频-语言模型在测试中表现不佳：错误地将倒放场景描述为正向播放、回答问题忽略视频内容、同意错误主张、难以处理基本相机运动、无法在简单时空遮挡下聚合时序信息。人类在这些任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 当前视频-语言模型在基础视频理解能力上存在严重不足，需要更严格的评估方法和改进的模型架构。REVEAL基准为未来研究提供了可扩展的评估工具。

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

### [8] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SYNC损失函数，将后验选择性方法（如softmax响应）的选择先验信息整合到SelectiveNet的训练过程中，实现了先验和后验选择性方法的协同优化，显著提升了选择性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前选择性预测方法要么是ad-hoc（修改网络架构或目标函数），要么是post-hoc（分析模型概率输出），作者发现后验方法生成的选择先验信息在训练阶段同样重要但未被充分利用。

Method: 提出SYNC损失函数，将softmax响应作为选择先验信息整合到SelectiveNet的训练过程中，实现ad-hoc和post-hoc方法的协同训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Stanford Cars等数据集上验证，方法不仅提升了模型泛化能力，而且在选择性预测性能上超越了之前的工作，达到了新的state-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: 选择性先验信息在训练阶段的整合对于提升深度神经网络的选择性预测能力至关重要，SYNC损失成功实现了这一整合，为选择性预测领域提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目视觉-惯性里程计在低纹理环境中因稀疏视觉特征不足而性能受限，现有基于ViT的密集深度估计模型计算需求大，无法实时部署在边缘设备上。

Method: 将学习到的深度先验直接集成到VINS-Mono优化后端，实施仿射不变深度一致性和成对序数约束，通过基于方差的门控机制显式过滤不稳定伪影。

Result: 在TartanGround和M3ED数据集上的实验表明，该方法在挑战性场景中防止发散，绝对轨迹误差降低高达28.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了低纹理环境下的VIO性能问题，在保持边缘设备计算效率的同时实现了显著的精度提升，为实时密集深度辅助的视觉-惯性里程计提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

TL;DR: ArtContext：基于CLIP和LoRA的艺术史文献标注管道，通过弱监督学习构建领域专用模型PaintingCLIP，为艺术品提供上下文信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术史文章常讨论艺术品整体和具体细节，但观看艺术品时难以快速了解相关文献讨论内容，需要系统化的信息标注方法

Method: 提出ArtContext管道：1) 新颖的语料收集管道整合开放获取艺术史文章和Wikidata知识 2) 使用LoRA技术适配CLIP模型创建领域专用模型PaintingCLIP 3) 通过弱监督学习训练模型

Result: PaintingCLIP模型在性能上超越原始CLIP模型，能够有效为给定艺术品提供上下文信息

Conclusion: 该管道具有通用性，可轻松应用于多个人文学科领域，为艺术品与相关文献建立有效连接

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

*Alan Baade,Eric Ryan Chan,Kyle Sargent,Changan Chen,Justin Johnson,Ehsan Adeli,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Forcing是一种对现有架构的简单修改，通过在潜在空间和像素空间使用分别调优的噪声调度进行联合处理，实现了潜在扩散的效率同时直接在原始自然图像上操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但失去了端到端建模的优势，在图像编码过程中丢弃信息，需要单独训练的解码器，并且建模的是原始数据的辅助分布。

Method: 提出Latent Forcing方法，通过联合处理潜在表示和像素，使用分别调优的噪声调度来排序去噪轨迹，让潜在表示在生成高频像素特征前充当中间计算的草稿空间。

Result: 在ImageNet上，Latent Forcing在扩散变换器基像素生成方面达到了新的最先进性能，特别是在当前计算规模下。

Conclusion: 条件信号顺序对性能至关重要，该方法成功解释了tokenizer中的REPA蒸馏与扩散模型之间的差异、条件与非条件生成的差异，以及tokenizer重建质量与可扩散性之间的关系。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

TL;DR: 提出使用近各向同性高分辨率CTA数据训练神经隐式函数，以解决短轴CMRI的各向异性限制，实现任意分辨率的心脏形状重建，在RV和MYO重建中表现出良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短轴心血管磁共振成像(CMRI)的各向异性特性限制了心脏形状分析，需要解决分辨率不一致的问题。

Method: 利用近各向同性的高分辨率CT血管造影(CTA)数据训练单一神经隐式函数，联合表示任意分辨率的CMRI心脏形状，特别针对右心室(RV)和心肌(MYO)进行重建。

Result: 通过从重建形状中提取4腔心切片进行评估，RV和MYO的Dice相似系数分别为0.91±0.07和0.75±0.13，Hausdorff距离分别为6.21±3.97mm和7.53±5.13mm。

Conclusion: 该方法能够重建准确、平滑且解剖学上合理的心脏形状，定量和定性评估均表明其在改善心脏形状分析方面的潜力。

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

Conclusion: Ctrl&Shift成功实现了无需显式3D建模的几何一致目标操作，为电影后期制作、AR和创意编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了针对超低场(ULF)扩散张量成像(DTI)的九方向单壳层序列，配套开发了具有角度依赖性的贝叶斯偏置场校正算法和基于卷积神经网络的超分辨率算法DiffSR，能够恢复ULF下的白质微结构和体积信息，并可用于阿尔茨海默病的白质分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便携式超低场磁共振成像虽然有望扩大神经影像学的应用范围，但目前存在空间和角度分辨率粗糙、信噪比低的问题。DTI序列特别容易受到这些成像质量下降的影响，且ULF DTI扫描在空间和角度域都存在伪影，需要定制化建模算法进行校正。

Method: 开发了九方向单壳层ULF DTI序列，配套贝叶斯偏置场校正算法（具有角度依赖性）和基于CNN的超分辨率算法DiffSR。DiffSR无需重新训练即可泛化到不同DTI数据集。通过合成降采样实验和真实匹配的ULF与高场DTI扫描进行白质评估。

Result: 算法能够恢复ULF下的白质微结构和体积信息。DiffSR可直接应用于合成降质扫描中的白质阿尔茨海默病分类，与未降质扫描相比，DTI指标一致性显著改善。

Conclusion: 研究开发的算法有效解决了ULF DTI的成像质量问题，为ULF重建方法和通用DTI序列协调化提供了重要工具。所有DiffSR相关代码已公开发布供社区使用。

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出ARFC框架，通过自回归模型实现任意压缩比的特征压缩，无需为不同压缩比训练专门模型，在多个任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征压缩方法需要为不同压缩比训练专门模型，缺乏灵活性和泛化能力，需要重新训练来适应新压缩比。

Method: 基于自回归模型的任意比压缩器(ARC)，通过调整生成token数量控制压缩比；引入混合解模块(MoS)提升压缩质量，集成实体关系图约束(ERGC)保持语义结构关系。

Result: 在跨模态检索、图像分类和图像检索任务上，该方法在各种压缩比下均优于现有方法，某些情况下甚至超过未压缩原始特征性能。

Conclusion: ARFC框架在资源受限场景下具有有效性和通用性，为特征压缩提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: VasoMIM作为基础模型在X射线血管造影分析任务中具有巨大潜力，框架和数据集将开源提供。

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

Conclusion: MFdiff模型成功解决了多模态PET图像恢复中的融合不一致和分布外数据问题，为低剂量PET成像提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 生成式压缩框架有效解决了传统去噪方法的感知质量问题，通过结合压缩和生成模型实现了失真与感知的良好平衡，为感知驱动的图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: FlowAdapt为多智能体V2X协同感知提供了一种高效且稳定的领域自适应解决方案，通过最优传输理论框架成功解决了传统PEFT方法在多智能体环境中的局限性

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: LLM-DRS框架为结构健康监测提供了自动化的报告生成能力，有效支持工程评估和决策制定，是AI辅助视觉结构健康监测的重要进展。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

Conclusion: PLOT-CT通过预对数域Voronoi分解有效解决了低剂量CT重建中的噪声放大和信息丢失问题，为医学影像重建提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

Conclusion: PLESS有效提高了伪标签的可靠性和空间一致性，为弱监督医学图像分割提供了通用的增强策略，代码将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的表面重建方法，将SDF表面重建问题转化为求解泊松方程的代理PDE问题，利用格林函数获得闭式解，通过解的叠加来恢复目标形状的隐式场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Eikonal PDE的SDF学习方法存在局限性，需要探索新的代理PDE方法来改进高频细节的近似效果。

Method: 将表面重建编码为泊松方程的求解问题，利用泊松方程与静电势的物理联系，通过格林函数获得闭式参数表达式，利用线性叠加原理构建隐式场。

Result: 方法在近似高频细节方面表现出改进效果，即使在少量形状先验的情况下也能获得良好结果。

Conclusion: 通过泊松方程代理PDE方法，提供了一种有效的表面重建替代方案，特别在处理高频细节方面优于传统Eikonal PDE方法。

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

*Ryan Deem,Garrett Goodman,Waqas Majeed,Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan,Michail S. Alexiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种基于ResNet的脑肿瘤分类模型（BrainNet、BrainNeXt、DilationNet）对抗FGSM和PGD攻击的鲁棒性，发现在不同预处理配置下，BrainNeXt模型对黑盒攻击最具鲁棒性，而缩小分辨率和非增强数据会显著降低模型抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤MRI分类模型的对抗鲁棒性研究不足但至关重要，特别是在临床部署场景中，需要评估深度学习模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性和恢复能力。

Method: 使用三种基于ResNet架构的模型（BrainNet、BrainNeXt、DilationNet），在三种预处理配置（完整尺寸增强、缩小尺寸增强、缩小尺寸非增强）的MRI数据集上，评估其对FGSM和PGD梯度攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: BrainNeXt模型对黑盒攻击表现出最高鲁棒性（可能归因于其增加的基数），但生成的对抗样本可迁移性较弱；BrainNet和Dilation模型更容易受到彼此攻击；缩小分辨率和非增强数据显著降低模型鲁棒性，即使未篡改测试精度仍然很高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在脑MRI分析的实际部署中，需要联合评估分类性能和对抗鲁棒性，输入分辨率和对抗脆弱性之间存在关键权衡关系。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GR-Diffusion框架结合离散高斯表示(GR)的几何先验和扩散模型的生成能力，用于3D低剂量全身PET重建，通过分层引导机制实现全局一致性和局部细节恢复，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET重建面临噪声放大、结构模糊和细节丢失的挑战，传统基于点或体素的方法存在低通限制，需要一种能同时保持全局结构和局部细节的重建方法。

Method: 提出GR-Diffusion框架：1)使用GR从投影数据生成参考3D PET图像；2)采用分层引导机制，细粒度引导通过差异图优化局部细节，粗粒度引导使用多尺度差异图校正偏差；3)扩散模型顺序整合GR的几何先验并恢复亚体素信息。

Result: 在UDPET和临床数据集的不同剂量水平实验中，GR-Diffusion在增强3D全身PET图像质量和保留生理细节方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: GR-Diffusion成功整合了几何先验和生成模型，为3D低剂量PET重建提供了物理基础和结构明确的基准，有效克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: SToRM是首个用于多模态LLM的监督式token减少框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中计算效率与性能平衡的问题，为资源受限环境下的高效人车交互提供了可行方案

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clutt3R-Seg是一个零样本3D实例分割管道，通过分层实例树和语义线索处理杂乱场景中的遮挡和噪声掩码问题，支持语言引导的机器人抓取任务。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上评估，在杂乱和稀疏视图场景中始终优于最先进基线。在最挑战的重度杂乱序列中，AP@25达到61.66，比基线高2.2倍以上；仅用4个输入视图就比使用8个视图的MaskClustering性能高2倍以上。

Conclusion: CluttR3-Seg通过创新的分层实例树方法有效解决了杂乱环境中的3D实例分割问题，在保持高精度的同时显著减少了所需视图数量，为语言引导的机器人操作提供了可靠的感知基础。

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

TL;DR: 本文提出了颈戴式视角的视线估计新任务，通过颈戴摄像头估计用户视线方向。建立了首个包含8名参与者日常活动约4小时视频的数据集，评估了基于Transformer的GLC模型，并提出了视线超出边界分类和多视角协同学习两种扩展方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视线估计研究主要集中于头戴式摄像头，而其他视角（如颈戴式）的研究相对不足。为填补这一空白，需要探索颈戴摄像头视角下的视线估计任务。

Method: 1) 收集首个颈戴视角视线估计数据集；2) 评估Transformer-based的GLC模型；3) 提出视线超出边界分类辅助任务；4) 提出多视角协同学习方法，使用几何感知辅助损失联合训练头戴和颈戴视角模型。

Result: 实验结果表明：视线超出边界分类任务相比标准微调提升了性能，但多视角协同学习方法未带来明显增益。

Conclusion: 颈戴式视线估计是一个有前景的研究方向，视线超出边界分类是有效的性能提升策略，而多视角协同学习在当前设置下效果有限，需要进一步分析其适用条件。

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Conclusion: 所提出的潜在空间融合模型在轻量级设置下平衡了准确性和效率，适用于资源受限环境中的实时野火预测应用。

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/RI-Mamba.git.

Conclusion: 语义控制的LDM能够生成具有临床真实性的合成DSA图像，适用于下游算法开发、研究和培训用途。

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉提示范式STVG-R1，将时空视频定位任务重新表述为实例级识别问题，通过强化学习联合优化时空准确性和结构格式，在多个基准测试中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在密集预测任务中经常出现文本描述与视觉坐标不对齐的问题，导致幻觉现象。现有方法需要额外可训练模块，带来高昂标注成本和计算开销。

Method: 将逐帧坐标预测重新表述为紧凑的实例级识别问题，为每个对象分配唯一且时间一致的ID作为视觉提示；引入首个STVG强化学习框架，使用任务驱动奖励联合优化时间准确性、空间一致性和结构格式正则化。

Result: 在HCSTVG-v2基准上超越基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B达20.9% m_IoU，建立新SOTA；在MeViS多目标参考视频对象分割任务上实现零样本泛化，达到47.3% J&F的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的视觉提示范式和强化学习框架有效解决了视觉-文本坐标对齐问题，避免了额外模块的引入，在时空视频定位任务中表现出卓越性能并具有良好的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进视觉对比解码(VCD)的方法，通过构建物体对齐的辅助视图来减少多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。该方法利用自监督视觉Transformer的物体中心注意力机制，移除最显著视觉证据来构建辅助视图，从而破坏不受支持的token并产生更强的对比信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)中的物体幻觉问题，即模型生成与图像内容不符的物体描述，这是当前MLLMs面临的主要挑战之一。

Method: 基于视觉对比解码(VCD)框架，构建物体对齐的辅助视图：1)利用自监督Vision Transformer的物体中心注意力识别最显著视觉证据；2)移除这些证据构建辅助视图；3)通过对比原始视图和辅助视图的输出，增强对幻觉token的抑制。该方法具有提示无关、模型无关的特性，计算开销小。

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了自适应去偏Tsallis熵（ADTE）方法，通过引入类别特定的非广延参数q^l来替代传统香农熵，有效解决CLIP模型在测试时适应中因预训练数据不平衡导致的偏差问题，无需超参数调优即可提升跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流测试时适应方法使用香农熵测量预测不确定性，但CLIP模型在高度不平衡的网络爬取数据上预训练存在内置偏差，导致香农熵产生有偏估计，需要更合适的熵度量方法。

Method: 基于Tsallis熵（TE）的广义形式，提出自适应去偏Tsallis熵（ADTE），通过归一化持续输入测试实例的估计标签偏差为每个类别定制参数q^l，自适应选择高置信度视图并与标签调整策略集成。

Result: ADTE在ImageNet及其五个变体上优于最先进方法，在10个跨域基准测试中实现最高平均性能，不受模型架构或文本提示影响。

Conclusion: Tsallis熵和ADTE可作为香农熵的直接高级替代方案，有效解决视觉语言模型测试时适应的偏差问题，提供无需分布特定超参数调优的适应性解决方案。

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jinx630/ADTE.

Conclusion: Code2Worlds成功解决了4D动态生成的关键挑战，通过代码生成范式实现了物理真实的动态场景模拟，为构建世界模拟器提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Conclusion: Light4D提供了一个有效的无需训练框架，成功解决了4D视频重照明中的时间一致性和极端视角挑战，为4D内容生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

Conclusion: Targeted Smart Filtering方法有效解决了3D分形生成的速度和多样性问题，为动作识别预训练提供了高效的合成数据生成方案

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Conclusion: 预测性视频嵌入能够有效弥补现有视觉表示在VLA中的关键不足，通过丢弃不可预测的环境因素并编码任务相关的时间动态，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RF模型反演方法存在跨时间步的近似误差累积问题，导致速度场不稳定，重建和编辑质量下降，需要一种训练自由的梯度校正方法来改善这一状况。

Method: 提出PMI方法，通过将速度场引导至过去速度的运行平均值（约束在理论推导的球形高斯范围内）来稳定速度场；同时开发mimic-CFG方案，在当前速度与其历史平均投影之间进行插值，平衡编辑效果与结构一致性。

Result: 在PIE-Bench上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提高了反演稳定性、图像重建质量和编辑保真度，同时减少了神经函数评估次数，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PMI和mimic-CFG方法为RF模型提供了理论严谨且高效的反演和编辑解决方案，在保持高质量生成的同时解决了现有方法的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: 成功将代理缩放优势内化到MLLM单次前向传播中，实现了无需缩放工具的细粒度感知提升，并讨论了何时需要'Thinking-with-Images'方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

Result: 在不同扫描几何和解剖区域的广泛评估表明，基于合成数据训练的模型在性能上持续优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论分析和展开网络架构，成功实现了无需真实临床数据的环形伪影校正，为CT图像质量提升提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于隐式神经表示和去噪扩散模型的新型框架，自动生成LGE图像和对应分割掩码，通过数据增强提升心肌瘢痕分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LGE成像是心肌瘢痕评估的临床标准，但标注数据有限限制了自动化分割方法的发展，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INRs)捕获LGE数据和分割掩码的连续空间表示，压缩为紧凑潜在嵌入，然后通过扩散模型在潜在空间生成新表示并解码为合成图像和掩码

Result: 在133个心脏MRI扫描上的实验表明，使用200个合成体积增强训练数据可将纤维化分割的Dice分数从0.509提升至0.524

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需标注的方法来缓解数据稀缺问题，代码已公开可用

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估基于视觉语言模型的PDF转Markdown转换在法语文档上的表现，提出了一个针对法语文档的基准测试，通过模型分歧采样选择困难页面，采用单元测试式评估方法关注具体失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注英语或中文，对格式和线性化选择的惩罚过于严格，而这些对下游任务影响不大。文档解析是RAG流程的关键步骤，转录和布局错误会传播到下游检索和基础任务。

Method: 从60,000个文档语料库中通过模型分歧采样选择困难页面构建法语基准测试，包含手写表格、复杂布局、密集表格和图形丰富页面。采用单元测试式检查方法，针对文本存在性、阅读顺序和局部表格约束等具体失败模式，结合类别特定归一化来消除仅展示性差异。

Result: 在15个模型中，最强专有模型在手写和表格处理上表现出显著更高的鲁棒性，而多个开源权重系统在标准印刷布局上仍具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究为法语文档的PDF到Markdown转换提供了专门的评估框架，揭示了不同模型在处理不同类型文档内容时的性能差异，为改进文档解析技术提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的概率优化框架，通过CUB-Loss损失函数和DTS后处理策略，解决医疗影像AI模型校准问题，使不确定性估计与预测正确性对齐，在三个医疗影像任务上验证了有效性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像决策支持系统中，AI模型的可靠性至关重要。虽然深度学习模型准确性高，但存在校准不足问题，表现为对错误预测过度自信，需要让模型能够量化不确定性以帮助临床医生识别不可靠输出。

Method: 1) 提出置信度-不确定性边界损失(CUB-Loss)，惩罚高确定性错误和低确定性正确预测；2) 设计双温度缩放(DTS)策略进行后处理校准，改进后验分布；3) 在肺炎筛查、糖尿病视网膜病变检测和皮肤病变识别三个医疗影像任务上验证。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际临床部署潜力，能够提高AI辅助医疗决策的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在美学图像合成中表现出色，但在复杂空间理解和推理方面存在局限。现有方法要么计算成本高（联合训练），要么空间信息丢失严重（仅依赖文本提示）。

Method: 提出空间思维链(SCoT)框架：1)通过文本-坐标交替指令格式训练增强扩散模型的布局感知能力；2)利用先进MLLM作为规划器生成详细布局计划，直接将其空间规划能力迁移到生成过程。

Result: 在图像生成基准测试中达到最先进性能，在复杂推理任务上显著超越基线方法，在图像编辑场景中也显示出强大效果。

Conclusion: SCoT是一种即插即用的有效框架，成功弥合了MLLM的推理能力与扩散模型生成能力之间的差距，为解决复杂空间理解问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Motivation: 新生儿复苏的准确记录对质量改进和临床指南遵循至关重要，但实践中使用不足。现有3D-CNN和ViT方法在识别细粒度活动方面存在挑战，需要探索生成式AI的潜力

Method: 使用包含13.26小时模拟新生儿复苏视频的数据集，评估多种零样本VLM策略和带有分类头的微调VLM（包括LoRA微调），并与TimeSFormer基线进行比较

Result: 小型本地VLM存在幻觉问题，但经过LoRA微调后，F1分数达到0.91，显著超越TimeSformer的0.70结果

Conclusion: 生成式AI方法特别是经过LoRA微调的VLM在新生儿复苏活动识别方面表现出色，为解决细粒度活动识别挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

Abstract: Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像到海报生成需要同时处理局部调整和高层次设计理解，包括文本、布局、风格和视觉元素的生成，同时保持语义保真度和美学一致性。这一过程涉及实体保留的局部编辑和概念驱动的全局创作两个相互交织的需求。

Method: 提出PosterOmni框架，通过三步流程：(i)构建覆盖六种任务类型的多场景数据集；(ii)在局部和全局专家之间进行知识蒸馏以进行监督微调；(iii)应用统一的奖励反馈机制来联合对齐视觉实体保留和美学偏好。还建立了统一的基准测试PosterOmni-Bench。

Conclusion: PosterOmni成功解决了图像到海报生成中局部编辑与全局创作的耦合需求，提供了一个统一的框架来处理实体保留和概念驱动的多任务生成，在多个维度上实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

Motivation: 传统的监督微调无法纠正未见状态下的策略漂移，而偏好优化方法需要昂贵的偏好对或奖励建模，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出FAIL框架，包含FAIL-PD（利用可微ODE求解器获取低方差路径梯度）和FAIL-PG（适用于离散或计算受限环境的黑盒替代方案）两种算法。

Result: 仅使用13,000个演示样本微调FLUX模型，在提示跟随和美学基准测试中达到竞争性性能，并能有效泛化到离散图像和视频生成任务。

Conclusion: FAIL不仅是一种有效的后训练方法，还能作为鲁棒正则化器缓解基于奖励的优化中的奖励破解问题，为流匹配模型的对齐提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization.

TL;DR: TexSpot是一个基于扩散的纹理增强框架，引入Texlet新型3D纹理表示，结合了点基纹理的几何表现力和UV表示的紧凑性，通过扩散变换器提升多视角扩散方法生成的纹理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流多视角扩散流水线存在视角不一致问题，现有方法要么依赖UV映射（展开时存在扭曲），要么使用点基方法（纹理保真度与几何密度紧密耦合，限制高分辨率纹理生成）。

Method: 提出Texlet表示，使用2D编码器编码局部纹理块，通过3D编码器聚合全局形状上下文，采用级联3D到2D解码器重建高质量纹理块。基于此训练条件扩散变换器来优化多视角扩散方法生成的纹理。

Conclusion: TexSpot通过创新的Texlet表示和扩散变换器，有效解决了3D纹理生成中的视角不一致和分辨率限制问题，为高质量3D纹理生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

TL;DR: DreamID-Omni是一个统一的可控人中心音视频生成框架，通过对称条件扩散变换器和双级解耦策略解决多人场景中的身份-音色绑定问题，在多任务训练方案下实现全面的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将人中心任务（参考音视频生成、视频编辑、音频驱动视频动画）作为孤立目标处理，且在多角色身份和音色控制方面存在挑战，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出对称条件扩散变换器整合异质条件信号；采用双级解耦策略（同步RoPE信号级绑定和结构化描述语义级映射）；设计多任务渐进训练方案利用弱约束先验正则化强约束任务。

Result: 大量实验表明DreamID-Omni在视频、音频和音视频一致性方面达到全面的最先进性能，甚至超越领先的商业专有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了身份-音色绑定失败和说话人混淆问题，建立了统一的音视频生成方法，将弥合学术研究与商业级应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

TL;DR: EO-VAE是一个多传感器变分自编码器，作为地球观测领域的基础分词器，能够通过动态超网络处理不同传感器规格和可变光谱通道，相比传统方法在重建保真度上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的生成模型依赖分词器将高维输入压缩为潜在表示，但地球观测数据因传感器规格多样和光谱通道可变而面临独特挑战，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出EO-VAE多传感器变分自编码器，使用单一模型通过动态超网络编码和重建灵活通道组合，避免为每种模态训练独立分词器。

Result: 在TerraMesh数据集上的实验表明，EO-VAE相比TerraMind分词器实现了更优的重建保真度。

Conclusion: EO-VAE为遥感领域的潜在生成建模建立了稳健的基线，为多传感器地球观测数据提供了高效的分词解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

Motivation: 解决当前统一多模态模型参数量过大（>10B）导致的训练成本高和部署困难问题，提供轻量高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Stacked Channel Bridging（SCB）深度对齐框架，从多VLM层提取层次特征并与可学习的'think tokens'融合；采用三阶段训练策略：对齐预训练、联合监督微调、基于MR-GRPO的强化学习。

Result: 仅使用~50M样本训练，在多个基准测试中取得领先性能：WISE上超越80B HunyuanImage 28%，UniREditBench上超越27B Qwen-Image-Edit 37%。

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0为统一多模态研究提供了高效、高性能的轻量级解决方案，通过开源代码、权重和数据集推动该领域民主化发展。

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.

TL;DR: Monarch-RT：一种用于实时视频生成的稀疏注意力参数化方法，通过Monarch矩阵分解注意力，在保持计算效率的同时实现高表达能力，首次在单张RTX 5090上实现16FPS的真正实时视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频生成中的扩散变换器受限于3D自注意力的二次计算成本，特别是在少步数和自回归的实时场景中，现有稀疏注意力方法在此场景下失效。视频注意力具有周期性结构和动态稀疏语义对应关系，超出了传统稀疏注意力的表示能力。

Method: 提出Monarch-RT结构化注意力参数化方法，使用Monarch矩阵分解注意力，通过适当对齐的块结构和扩展的分块Monarch参数化实现高效计算。通过微调和定制Triton内核克服参数化开销。

Result: Monarch-RT在现有稀疏基线方法上表现出更高效率，在state-of-the-art模型Self-Forcing上实现高达95%的注意力稀疏度且无质量损失。优化实现在不同GPU上比FlashAttention内核快1.4-11.8倍。

Conclusion: Monarch-RT是首个针对实时视频生成的高能力稀疏注意力参数化工作，成功解决了实时视频生成的计算瓶颈问题，为实时视频生成应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

TL;DR: UniT是一个多模态思维链测试时扩展框架，使统一模型能够通过迭代推理、验证和精炼来处理复杂多模态任务，结合了智能数据合成、统一模型训练和灵活推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型通常单次处理而不迭代精炼输出，无法有效处理需要指令分解、中间结果验证和迭代修正的复杂空间组合、多对象交互或动态指令任务。

Method: 提出UniT框架，通过智能数据合成创建训练数据，训练统一模型处理多轮推理，支持验证、子目标分解和内容记忆等认知行为，采用序列思维链推理策略。

Result: (1) 在短推理轨迹上训练的模型能泛化到更长推理链；(2) 序列思维链推理比并行采样更具可扩展性和计算效率；(3) 生成和编辑轨迹训练提升分布外视觉推理能力。

Conclusion: 多模态测试时扩展是推进统一模型生成和理解能力的有效范式，UniT框架为复杂多模态任务提供了迭代推理解决方案。

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

Motivation: 传统视觉幻觉依赖空间操作，本文探索时间维度上的语义转换，使单幅草图通过笔划添加实现戏剧性语义转变。

Method: 采用序列感知联合优化框架和双分支SDS机制，动态调整前缀笔划以发现共同结构子空间，并引入覆盖损失确保空间互补性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了双重约束问题，实现了时间维度上的渐进语义幻觉，为矢量草图生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

TL;DR: HybridRAG是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过预处理PDF文档生成问答知识库，在查询时优先匹配预先生成的答案，仅在无匹配时进行实时生成，实现了更准确和更快速的聊天机器人响应。

Motivation: 现有RAG方法通常假设结构化的文本源并在查询时进行检索和生成，这限制了其在现实聊天机器人场景中的适用性，特别是在处理大量非结构化文档和有限计算资源的情况下。

Method: 1) 通过OCR和布局分析处理包含复杂布局的非结构化PDF文档，转换为分层文本块；2) 使用LLM从组织好的文本块预生成问答知识库；3) 查询时优先匹配预生成QA对，仅在无匹配时进行实时响应生成。

Result: 在OHRBench上的实验表明，HybridRAG相比标准RAG基线提供了更高的答案质量和更低的延迟。

Conclusion: HybridRAG是处理大量非结构化文档和有限计算资源下现实聊天机器人应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for grounding Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot responses on external knowledge. However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐主要基于英语，导致非英语特别是低资源语言存在安全漏洞，需要研究多语言安全对齐的有效方法

Method: 使用~28,000个多语言越狱提示，通过黑盒响应式参数高效微调(LoRA)，将OpenAI o1-mini的拒绝行为蒸馏到Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct、Gemma-2-2B-IT和Qwen3-8B三个开源学生模型

Result: 标准微调教师模型的"安全"拒绝数据意外增加了所有学生模型的越狱成功率(最高16.6个百分点)，移除边界拒绝可缓解安全退化但降低GSM8K推理性能

Conclusion: 研究揭示了知识蒸馏在多语言安全对齐中的挑战和潜力，为未来研究提供了基础，表明需要更精细的方法来处理多语言环境下的安全对齐问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, yet their safety alignment remains predominantly English-centric. This allows for vulnerabilities in non-English contexts, especially with low-resource languages. We introduce a novel application of knowledge distillation (KD) in the context of multilingual jailbreak prevention, examining its efficacy. We distill the refusal behaviors of a proprietary teacher model (OpenAI o1-mini) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into three open-source student models: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-2B-IT, and Qwen3-8B, using ~28,000 multilingual jailbreak prompts from XSafety via black-box response-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluation on the MultiJail benchmark reveals a counterintuitive behavior: standard fine-tuning on the teacher's ``safe'' refusal data inadvertently increases Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) for all student models, up to 16.6 percentage points. Our experiments reveal a divergent generalization to unseen languages during distillation, with varying outcomes depending on the base model. By removing a primary source of safety degradation, nuanced `boundary' refusals, we mitigate or even reverse safety declines in student models, although reductions in reasoning performance (GSM8K) persist. Overall, our exploratory study highlights the challenges and potential of KD as a technique for multilingual safety alignment, offering a foundation for future research in this direction.

Motivation: 先前研究主要基于静态统计数据识别平均表现的检索头，忽视了自回归生成中的细粒度时间动态特性。

Method: 通过在Needle-in-a-Haystack任务和多跳QA任务上进行广泛分析，验证动态检索头的三个核心特性，并在动态检索增强生成框架中量化动态与静态检索头的效用差异。

Result: 确立了三个核心发现：(1)检索头随时间步动态变化；(2)动态检索头具有时间步特异性且无法被静态检索头有效替代；(3)隐藏状态编码了预测未来检索模式的信号。

Conclusion: 研究为理解大语言模型的内部机制提供了新视角，揭示了检索头的动态特性和内部规划机制，对改进检索增强生成方法具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent studies have identified "retrieval heads" in Large Language Models (LLMs) responsible for extracting information from input contexts. However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. Our study provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing that aims to identify and extract key entities from unstructured text. We present a novel application of NER in plasma physics research articles and address the challenges of extracting specialized entities from scientific text in this domain. Research articles in plasma physics often contain highly complex and context-rich content that must be extracted to enable, e.g., advanced search. We propose a lightweight approach based on encoder-transformers and conditional random fields to extract (nested) named entities from plasma physics research articles. First, we annotate a plasma physics corpus with 16 classes specifically designed for the nested NER task. Second, we evaluate an entity-specific model specialization approach, where independent BERT-CRF models are trained to recognize individual entity types in plasma physics text. Third, we integrate an optimization process to systematically fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model performance. Our work contributes to the advancement of entity recognition in plasma physics and also provides a foundation to support researchers in navigating and analyzing scientific literature.

TL;DR: RECOM基准测试发现LLMs在回答近期Reddit问题时存在语义-词汇悖论：模型通过广泛释义保持语义相似性（余弦相似度>99%），但词汇重叠率极低（BLEU-1<8%），表明传统词汇指标不足以评估抽象生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在开放域问答任务中对近期信息的处理能力，以及其输出与人类共识的对齐程度，现有评估方法主要依赖词汇匹配指标，无法充分捕捉语义保真度。

Method: 构建包含15,000个近期Reddit问题-答案对的RECOM数据集，评估4个开源LLM（Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B、Gemma-2-9B、GPT-OSS-20B），使用词汇指标（BLEU、ROUGE）、语义相似度（BERTScore、MoverScore、余弦相似度）和逻辑推理（NLI）进行多维度分析。

Result: 发现显著的语义-词汇差距（90+百分点差异），模型规模与性能不相关（Mistral-7B优于GPT-OSS-20B），矛盾率低于7%，MoverScore显示51-53%的语义对齐最优传输成本。

Conclusion: 词汇指标在评估抽象生成任务时不可靠，需要建立多维度评估框架来捕捉语义保真度，RECOM数据集为后续研究提供基准资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for open-domain question answering, yet their alignment with human perspectives on temporally recent information remains underexplored. We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and are often assumed to improve factual correctness. However, how the parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods affect hallucination behavior remains insufficiently understood, especially on QA datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of PEFT on hallucination detection through a comprehensive empirical study across three open-weight LLM backbones and three fact-seeking QA benchmarks. For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models.

TL;DR: FalseCite数据集用于系统研究LLM的幻觉现象，通过误导性引文诱导模型产生错误信息，并在GPT-4o-mini等模型上观察到幻觉增加。通过分析隐藏状态向量发现其呈现独特的角状结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学和法律等敏感领域产生幻觉（生成无意义或错误信息）的问题特别有害，需要系统性的研究方法。

Method: 引入FalseCite数据集，包含误导性或伪造的引文，用于基准测试GPT-4o-mini、Falcon-7B和Mistral 7-B等模型的幻觉行为，并分析其隐藏状态向量的可视化聚类。

Result: 发现带有欺骗性引文的虚假声明会显著增加幻觉活动（特别是在GPT-4o-mini中），隐藏状态向量无论是否产生幻觉都呈现独特的角状形状。

Conclusion: FalseCite为未来LLM研究中评估和缓解幻觉现象提供了有价值的基础工具和数据分析方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating nonsensical or false information that can be especially harmful in sensitive fields such as medicine or law. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce FalseCite, a curated dataset designed to capture and benchmark hallucinated responses induced by misleading or fabricated citations. Running GPT-4o-mini, Falcon-7B, and Mistral 7-B through FalseCite, we observed a noticeable increase in hallucination activity for false claims with deceptive citations, especially in GPT-4o-mini. Using the responses from FalseCite, we can also analyze the internal states of hallucinating models, visualizing and clustering the hidden state vectors. From this analysis, we noticed that the hidden state vectors, regardless of hallucination or non-hallucination, tend to trace out a distinct horn-like shape. Our work underscores FalseCite's potential as a foundation for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in future LLM research.

Method: 采用组合融合分析(CFA)框架，结合排名-分数特征(RSC)函数和认知多样性(CD)概念，集成多个相对优秀且相互多样化的分类模型。使用生成式AI模型生成合成数据进行训练。

Result: CFA技术实现了96.73%的分类性能，优于最佳单一模型。与人类领域专家的结果进行比较，证明多模型智能组合与人类专家输入能够相互补充和增强。

Conclusion: 通过CFA方法结合多个ML/AI模型的智能，并整合人类专家知识，可以有效提升文本分类性能，特别是在复杂类别结构的可持续发展目标分类任务中。

Abstract: (Natural Language Processing) NLP techniques such as text classification and topic discovery are very useful in many application areas including information retrieval, knowledge discovery, policy formulation, and decision-making. However, it remains a challenging problem in cases where the categories are unavailable, difficult to differentiate, or are interrelated. Social analysis with human context is an area that can benefit from text classification, as it relies substantially on text data. The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other.

### [83] [Disentangling Direction and Magnitude in Transformer Representations: A Double Dissociation Through L2-Matched Perturbation Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11169)
*Mangadoddi Srikar Vardhan,Lekkala Sai Teja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer隐藏状态中向量方向（角度）和大小（模长）具有不同的功能作用：角度扰动对语言建模损失影响更大（42.9倍），而大小扰动对句法处理损害更严重（20.4% vs 1.6%准确率下降）。角度损伤主要通过注意力通路传播，大小损伤则通过LayerNorm通路传播。这种分离模式在LayerNorm架构中普遍存在，但在RMSNorm架构中表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer隐藏状态中向量方向和大小是否具有不同的功能角色，尽管它们都以高维向量形式编码信息，但各自的计算作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用L2匹配扰动分析方法，确保角度和大小扰动产生相同的欧几里得位移。在Pythia系列模型上进行因果干预实验，通过注意力修复和LayerNorm修复来追踪损伤传播路径。

Result: 发现角度扰动对语言建模损失造成更大损害（高达42.9倍），而大小扰动对句法处理（如主谓一致）造成更严重损害（20.4% vs 1.6%准确率下降）。角度损伤28.4%通过注意力通路恢复，大小损伤29.9%通过LayerNorm通路恢复。这种模式在Pythia架构家族中跨尺度复现。

Conclusion: 向量方向和大小在LayerNorm架构中支持部分不同的计算角色：方向优先影响注意力路由，而大小调节精细句法判断的处理强度。这种分离取决于架构选择，RMSNorm架构表现出不同模式。研究结果细化了线性表示假说，对模型编辑和可解释性研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Transformer hidden states encode information as high-dimensional vectors, yet whether direction (orientation in representational space) and magnitude (vector norm) serve distinct functional roles remains unclear. Studying Pythia-family models, we discover a striking cross-over dissociation: angular perturbations cause up to 42.9 more damage to language modeling loss, while magnitude perturbations cause disproportionately more damage to syntactic processing (20.4% vs.1.6% accuracy drop on subject-verb agreement).This finding is enabled by L2-matched perturbation analysis, a methodology ensuring that an gular and magnitude perturbations achieve identical Euclidean displacements. Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments. We find different patterns in RMSNorm-based architectures, suggesting that the dissociation depends on architectural choices. Our results refine the linear representation hypothesis and have implications for model editing and interpretability research

TL;DR: PRIME是一个多智能体框架，通过执行器、验证器和协调器三个专门化智能体的协作，结合群体相对策略优化，显著提升大语言模型在算法推理任务上的性能，平均准确率从26.8%提升至93.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多样化推理任务上表现出色，但在算法推理方面性能有限，需要解决错误传播和状态跟踪等问题。

Method: 提出PRIME框架，包含三个专门化智能体：执行器负责逐步推理，验证器进行约束检查，协调器处理回溯控制，通过群体相对策略优化进行优化。

Result: 在PRIME-Bench基准测试中（86个任务，12个类别，51,600个实例），平均准确率提升250%，从26.8%提高到93.8%。需要持续状态跟踪的任务改进最大，如图灵机仿真从9%提升到92%，长除法从16%提升到94%。

Conclusion: 迭代验证是性能提升的主要因素，能防止错误传播；较小模型受益更大，能达到与8倍规模模型相当的准确率。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks, yet their performance on algorithmic reasoning remains limited. To handle this limitation, we propose PRIME (Policy-Reinforced Iterative Multi-agent Execution), a framework comprising three specialized agents, an executor for step-by-step reasoning, a verifier for constraint checking, and a coordinator for backtracking control, optimized through group relative policy optimization. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PRIME-Bench, the largest algorithmic reasoning benchmark to date, comprising 86 tasks across 12 categories with 51,600 instances. Tasks span sorting algorithms, graph and tree structures, automata and state machines, symbolic reasoning, and constraint-based puzzles, with execution traces reaching over one million steps. Compared to baseline approach, PRIME improves average accuracy from 26.8% to 93.8%, a 250% relative gain. The largest improvements occur on tasks requiring sustained state tracking, with Turing machine simulation improving from 9% to 92% and long division from 16% to 94%. Ablation studies identify iterative verification as the primary contributor, preventing the error propagation that causes baseline approaches to fail catastrophically. Analysis across model scales (8B-120B parameters) reveals that smaller models benefit disproportionately, achieving accuracy comparable to models 8x larger.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个集成预训练LLM领域知识到贝叶斯优化中的框架，用于高效搜索LoRA超参数，通过语言提示将离散超参数映射到连续空间，并利用数据子集代理训练进一步提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然使微调高效，但对超参数选择高度敏感，且穷举搜索计算成本高昂，需要一种更高效的超参数优化方法。

Method: 1) 将LLM重新用作离散到连续映射，通过语言提示注入LoRA领域知识；2) 使用可学习token建模难以语言描述的残差信息；3) 利用数据子集进行代理训练和评估。

Result: 仅需约30次迭代找到的超参数，相比标准方法从约45,000种组合中找到的超参数，性能提升超过20%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将LLM领域知识整合到贝叶斯优化中，显著提高了LoRA超参数搜索的效率和效果，为资源受限环境下的LLM微调提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables resource-efficient personalization or specialization, but it comes at the expense of additional hyperparameter tuning. Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Gemini 2.5 Flash和Pro TTS模型在五种印度语言中生成法庭辩护语音的性能，发现模型在程序性信息传达上表现良好，但在情感表达和语音动态调节方面存在局限，特别是在孟加拉语和古吉拉特语中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，TTS技术从基本可懂度转向上下文感知的富有表现力的合成。在法律领域，合成语音需要传达权威性和专业形象，这在印度多语言环境中尤为复杂。

Method: 提出了一个提示框架，利用Gemini 2.5对5种语言的原生支持和上下文感知节奏控制，生成不同的辩护人角色语音，并在泰米尔语、泰卢固语、孟加拉语、印地语和古吉拉特语中进行测试。

Result: 模型表现出"单调权威性"，擅长程序性信息传递，但在说服性辩护所需的动态语音调节和情感深度方面存在困难。孟加拉语和古吉拉特语的性能下降进一步突显了语音学方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 多语言TTS已准备好处理程序性法律任务，但在复制人类法律话语的说服艺术性方面仍面临挑战，需要进一步改进语音学处理能力。

Abstract: Legal advocacy requires a unique combination of authoritative tone, rhythmic pausing for emphasis, and emotional intelligence. This study investigates the performance of the Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS and Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS models in generating synthetic courtroom speeches across five Indic languages: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, and Gujarati. We propose a prompting framework that utilizes Gemini 2.5s native support for 5 languages and its context-aware pacing to produce distinct advocate personas. The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted the focus of TexttoSpeech (TTS) technology from basic intelligibility to context-aware, expressive synthesis. In the legal domain, synthetic speech must convey authority and a specific professional persona a task that becomes significantly more complex in the linguistically diverse landscape of India. The models exhibit a "monotone authority," excelling at procedural information delivery but struggling with the dynamic vocal modulation and emotive gravitas required for persuasive advocacy. Performance dips in Bengali and Gujarati further highlight phonological frontiers for future refinement. This research underscores the readiness of multilingual TTS for procedural legal tasks while identifying the remaining challenges in replicating the persuasive artistry of human legal discourse.

Motivation: 当前自动生成作者回复的方法未能充分利用作者的专业知识和意图，而实践中作者拥有领域专业知识、独有信息和修订策略等关键信号来有效回应审稿人意见。

Method: 提出REspGen生成框架，包含：1）显式作者输入集成；2）多属性控制；3）评估引导的优化。构建Re³Align数据集（首个大规模对齐的审阅-回复-修订三元组数据集）和REspEval评估套件（20+指标）。

Result: 实验表明：作者输入和评估引导优化带来明显收益；输入设计对回复质量有重要影响；控制性和质量之间存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 将作者专业知识整合到回复生成过程中能显著提升效果，提出的框架和数据集为作者辅助回复写作提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Author response (rebuttal) writing is a critical stage of scientific peer review that demands substantial author effort. Recent work frames this task as automatic text generation, underusing author expertise and intent. In practice, authors possess domain expertise, author-only information, revision and response strategies--concrete forms of author expertise and intent--to address reviewer concerns, and seek NLP assistance that integrates these signals to support effective response writing in peer review. We reformulate author response generation as an author-in-the-loop task and introduce REspGen, a generation framework that integrates explicit author input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement, together with REspEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite with 20+ metrics covering input utilization, controllability, response quality, and discourse. To support this formulation, we construct Re$^3$Align, the first large-scale dataset of aligned review--response--revision triplets, where revisions provide signals of author expertise and intent. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show the benefits of author input and evaluation-guided refinement, the impact of input design on response quality, and trade-offs between controllability and quality. We make our dataset, generation and evaluation tools publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化多语言预训练模型在不同书写系统上的处理差异，揭示tokenization对系统性能的影响

Method: 通过比较具有相同语言内容但不同正字法变体的文本，分析mBERT和XLM-R模型的token碎片化程度、推理速度和信息成本，使用字符级比特数(BPC)避免子词碎片化带来的NLL悖论

Result: 高碎片化正字法导致生育率增加3.4倍(6.73-6.85 vs 2.10-2.35 tokens/word)，推理速度降低16.5倍(0.23 vs 3.8 sentences/second)，信息成本显著增加(mBERT +19.7%，XLM-R +47.1%)

Conclusion: tokenization是多语言NLP中不平等问题的重要来源，需要开发脚本感知的tokenization和预训练方法

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual language models are often assumed to be script-agnostic, yet their tokenizers can impose systematic costs on certain writing systems. We quantify this script tax by comparing two orthographic variants with identical linguistic content. Across mBERT and XLM-R, the higher-fragmentation orthography shows a ~3.4x increase in fertility (6.73-6.85 vs. 2.10-2.35 tokens/word), leading to a 16.5x inference slowdown (0.23 vs. 3.8 sentences/second) on identical hardware. Using bits per character (BPC) to avoid the "NLL paradox" from subword fragmentation, we find a substantial increase in information cost: +19.7% for mBERT (8.06->9.65) and +47.1% for XLM-R (12.19->17.94). A round-trip conversion check (CER_rt=0.31) suggests these gaps reflect orthography-conditioned processing rather than mapping noise. Our results highlight tokenization as a key source of inequity in multilingual NLP and motivate script-aware tokenization and pretraining.

Motivation: Transformer已成为序列建模的基础架构，但在算术、逻辑推理和算法组合等离散推理任务中存在理论局限性，这是一个关键开放问题，需要从理论角度分析其结构性和计算性障碍。

Method: 采用三种理论框架的综合分析方法：电路复杂度（分析深度约束）、近似理论（分析不连续性逼近困难）、通信复杂度（分析token间通信瓶颈），通过回顾关键定义、开创性结果和示例来阐明问题。

Result: 识别了Transformer在符号计算中的核心挑战：深度限制导致无法实现某些计算、难以精确逼近不连续函数、token间通信存在瓶颈，这些因素共同限制了其在离散算法实现中的表现。

Conclusion: 当前Transformer架构在离散推理任务中存在根本性理论限制，需要新的模型设计思路来突破这些限制，本文为理解这些局限性提供了统一的理论框架，并指出了未来研究的可能方向。

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundational architecture for a broad spectrum of sequence modeling applications, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in natural language processing, vision, and beyond. However, their theoretical limitations in discrete reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic, logical inference, and algorithmic composition, remain a critical open problem. In this survey, we synthesize recent studies from three theoretical perspectives: circuit complexity, approximation theory, and communication complexity, to clarify the structural and computational barriers that transformers face when performing symbolic computations. By connecting these established theoretical frameworks, we provide an accessible and unified account of why current transformer architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms, even as they excel at pattern matching and interpolation. We review key definitions, seminal results, and illustrative examples, highlighting challenges such as depth constraints, difficulty approximating discontinuities, and bottlenecks in inter-token communication. Finally, we discuss implications for model design and suggest promising directions for overcoming these foundational limitations.

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型可作为有前景的时间推理器，捕捉重复性日常活动和上下文依赖的行为变化，增强代理模型的行为模块。

Abstract: Anticipating human activities and their durations is essential in applications such as smart-home automation, simulation-based architectural and urban design, activity-based transportation system simulation, and human-robot collaboration, where adaptive systems must respond to human activities. Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models.

Conclusion: 通过分析LLM内部表征变化并利用关键标记生成合成数据，为AD检测提供了有效的数据增强方法，解决了标记数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Reliable early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging, particularly due to limited availability of labeled data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong transfer capabilities across domains, adapting them to the AD domain through supervised fine-tuning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we fine-tune an LLM for AD detection and investigate how task-relevant information is encoded within its internal representations. We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples. We evaluate the synthesized data both intrinsically and by incorporating it into downstream training pipelines.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as an integral technique for extending the strengths and abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to gain significant performance gains in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This approach, which requires instructions to be composed in natural language to bring out the knowledge from LLMs in a structured way, has driven breakthroughs in various NLP tasks. Yet there is still no structured framework or coherent understanding of the varied prompt engineering methods and techniques, particularly in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG).
  This survey aims to help fill that gap by outlining recent developments in prompt engineering, and their effect on different NLG tasks. It reviews recent advances in prompting methods and their impact on NLG tasks, presenting prompt design as an input-level control mechanism that complements fine-tuning and decoding approaches. The paper introduces a taxonomy of prompting paradigms, a decision framework for prompt selection based on varying factors for the practitioners, outlines emerging trends and challenges, and proposes a framework that links design, optimization, and evaluation to support more controllable and generalizable NLG.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their internal decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Mechanistic interpretability (i.e., the systematic study of how neural networks implement algorithms through their learned representations and computational structures) has emerged as a critical research direction for understanding and aligning these models. This paper surveys recent progress in mechanistic interpretability techniques applied to LLM alignment, examining methods ranging from circuit discovery to feature visualization, activation steering, and causal intervention. We analyze how interpretability insights have informed alignment strategies including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), constitutional AI, and scalable oversight. Key challenges are identified, including the superposition hypothesis, polysemanticity of neurons, and the difficulty of interpreting emergent behaviors in large-scale models. We propose future research directions focusing on automated interpretability, cross-model generalization of circuits, and the development of interpretability-driven alignment techniques that can scale to frontier models.

Abstract: Code-mixing and code-switching (CSW) remain challenging phenomena for large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in multilingual modeling, LLMs often struggle in mixed-language settings, exhibiting systematic degradation in grammaticality, factuality, and safety behavior. This work provides a comprehensive overview of CSW research in modern large language model settings. We introduce a unifying taxonomy that organizes prior work along dimensions of data, modeling, and evaluation, and we distill these findings into a practical playbook of actionable recommendations for building, adapting, and evaluating CSW-capable LLMs. We review modeling approaches ranging from CSW-tailored pre-training and task-specific post-training to prompting strategies and in-context learning. We analyze current evaluation practices, highlighting sources of instability and limited reproducibility, and we catalog existing benchmarks while critically examining their linguistic coverage and English-centric biases. Finally, we discuss emerging safety concerns, including use of code-mixing as a mechanism for bypassing model safeguards, and identify open research challenges.

TL;DR: MetaMem是一个增强LLM记忆系统的框架，通过自进化元记忆机制教会模型如何有效利用记忆知识，在多项任务中显著超越基线方法3.6%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统虽然能够支持长程人机交互，但往往会破坏交互会话中的逻辑和时间关系，导致记忆单元碎片化和推理性能下降。

Method: 提出MetaMem框架，通过自我反思推理过程和执行动作来更新元记忆状态，迭代地提炼跨任务的可迁移知识利用经验，指导LLM系统性地识别和整合分散记忆片段中的关键证据。

Result: 大量实验证明MetaMem的有效性，显著超越强基线方法超过3.6%。

Conclusion: MetaMem通过元记忆优化机制成功解决了记忆碎片化问题，为LLM提供了系统性的知识利用指导，提升了长程交互中的推理性能。

Abstract: Existing memory systems enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to support long-horizon human-LLM interactions by persisting historical interactions beyond limited context windows. However, while recent approaches have succeeded in constructing effective memories, they often disrupt the inherent logical and temporal relationships within interaction sessions, resulting in fragmented memory units and degraded reasoning performance. In this paper, we propose MetaMem, a novel framework that augments memory systems with a self-evolving meta-memory, aiming to teach LLMs how to effectively utilize memorized knowledge. During meta-memory optimization, MetaMem iteratively distills transferable knowledge utilization experiences across different tasks by self-reflecting on reasoning processes and performing actions to update the current meta-memory state. The accumulated meta-memory units serve as explicit knowledge utilization experiences, guiding the LLM to systematically identify and integrate critical evidence from scattered memory fragments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaMem, which significantly outperforms strong baselines by over 3.6%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DDL2PropBank基准测试用于评估多智能体框架的开发者体验，通过将数据库模式映射到PropBank角色集的任务，比较10个框架的代码复杂性和AI辅助能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架缺乏在受控环境中评估开发者体验的原则性方法，需要系统化的评估基准。

Method: 采用Agent-as-a-Tool模式，在10个框架中实现相同的智能体逻辑，通过静态分析评估代码复杂度，并通过LLM自主生成框架特定代码的能力评估AI辅助性。

Result: 发现三倍复杂度谱系，Pydantic AI和Agno实现开销最小；结构对齐分数可可靠代理单模式框架的运行时成功率，但对多模式框架高估正确性；Agno综合表现最佳。

Conclusion: Agno框架在复杂度和AI辅助性方面表现最优，结构对齐可作为有效的代理指标，但需注意多模式框架的评估限制。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks promise to simplify LLM-driven software development, yet there is no principled way to evaluate their developer experience in a controlled setting. We introduce DDL2PropBank, a novel benchmark task that maps relational database schemas to PropBank rolesets, requiring autonomous retrieval of candidate frames and fine-grained linguistic reasoning over table names, columns, and relations. Using the Agent-as-a-Tool pattern, we implement identical agent logic across 10 frameworks and evaluate along two dimensions: (i) code complexity via static analysis, and (ii) AI-assistability -- the extent to which LLMs can autonomously generate correct, framework-specific code. Our results reveal a threefold complexity spectrum, with Pydantic AI and Agno requiring the least implementation overhead. For AI-assistability, structural alignment scores reliably proxy runtime success for frameworks with single canonical patterns, but overestimate correctness for multi-pattern frameworks. Agno emerges as the strongest overall performer, combining lowest complexity with highest structural alignment and 83% pass@1.

*Jiale Zhao,Ke Fang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了AskBench基准和RLVR方法，用于评估和改进大语言模型在需要澄清时的提问能力，通过交互式基准测试和强化学习提升模型在信息缺失或错误前提场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常在提示信息缺失或包含误导内容时产生幻觉或强化错误观念，需要评估和改进模型决定何时及如何寻求澄清的能力，同时不牺牲任务性能。

Method: 引入AskBench交互式基准，将标准问答对转换为多轮交互并设置明确检查点；提出基于验证器的强化学习(RLVR)，使用结构化评分标准指导澄清行为；涵盖AskMind(信息缺失)和AskOverconfidence(错误前提)两种场景。

Result: 实验显示该方法在准确性、评分标准遵循度和交互效率方面均有显著提升，且对未见领域具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AskBench基准和RLVR方法有效提升了LLMs在需要澄清场景下的表现，为模型交互能力的评估和改进提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond even when prompts omit critical details or include misleading information, leading to hallucinations or reinforced misconceptions. We study how to evaluate and improve LLMs' ability to decide when and what to ask for clarification without sacrificing task performance. We introduce AskBench, an interactive benchmark that converts standard QA pairs into multi-turn interactions with explicit checkpoints. A unified judge loop evaluates final answers and simulates user responses as needed. AskBench covers two settings: AskMind, with intent-deficient queries requiring clarification, and AskOverconfidence, with queries containing false premises that must be identified and corrected. We further propose rubric-guided reinforcement learning with verifier-based rewards (RLVR), which uses structured rubrics to encourage targeted clarification. Experiments show consistent improvements in accuracy, rubric adherence, and interaction efficiency, with strong generalization to unseen domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出NLDD指标评估思维链解释的忠实性，发现推理步骤在70-85%链长后对答案影响甚微，模型可能具有正确内部表征但仍任务失败


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链解释无法确定是模型实际推理过程还是事后合理化，需要量化评估推理步骤对模型决策的真实重要性

Method: 通过破坏思维链中的单个推理步骤并测量模型答案置信度下降程度，开发标准化对数差衰减(NLDD)指标进行跨模型比较

Result: 在句法、逻辑和算术任务中发现一致的70-85%推理边界，超过此边界步骤影响很小或为负；模型可能编码正确表征但仍任务失败

Conclusion: 准确率不能反映模型是否真正通过思维链推理，NLDD提供评估思维链重要性的方法，揭示模型内部推理机制

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations are widely used to interpret how language models solve complex problems, yet it remains unclear whether these step-by-step explanations reflect how the model actually reaches its answer, or merely post-hoc justifications. We propose Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), a metric that measures whether individual reasoning steps are faithful to the model's decision-making process. Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer. We also find that models can encode correct internal representations while completely failing the task. These results show that accuracy alone does not reveal whether a model actually reasons through its chain. NLDD offers a way to measure when CoT matters.

TL;DR: SurveyLens：首个跨学科自动综述生成评估基准，包含1000篇人工撰写的综述数据集和双视角评估框架，用于评估11种ASG方法在不同学科的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动综述生成(ASG)评估方法依赖通用指标且偏向计算机科学领域，无法评估各学科学术标准遵循情况，缺乏跨学科的质量评估指导

Method: 构建SurveyLens-1k数据集（10个学科的1000篇高质量人工综述），提出双视角评估框架：1）学科感知评分表评估（LLM+人工偏好权重）；2）标准对齐评估（内容覆盖和综合质量评估）

Result: 对11种先进ASG方法（原生LLM、ASG系统、深度研究代理）进行评估，揭示了各范式在不同领域的优势和劣势

Conclusion: SurveyLens提供了学科感知的ASG评估基准，为选择符合特定学科要求的工具提供了重要指导，填补了跨学科ASG评估的空白

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has driven the evolution of Automatic Survey Generation (ASG) from simple pipelines to multi-agent frameworks and commercial Deep Research agents. However, current ASG evaluation methods rely on generic metrics and are heavily biased toward Computer Science (CS), failing to assess whether ASG methods adhere to the distinct standards of various academic disciplines. Consequently, researchers, especially those outside CS, lack clear guidance on using ASG systems to yield high-quality surveys compliant with specific discipline standards. To bridge this gap, we introduce SurveyLens, the first discipline-aware benchmark evaluating ASG methods across diverse research disciplines. We construct SurveyLens-1k, a curated dataset of 1,000 high-quality human-written surveys spanning 10 disciplines. Subsequently, we propose a dual-lens evaluation framework: (1) Discipline-Aware Rubric Evaluation, which utilizes LLMs with human preference-aligned weights to assess adherence to domain-specific writing standards; and (2) Canonical Alignment Evaluation to rigorously measure content coverage and synthesis quality against human-written survey papers. We conduct extensive experiments by evaluating 11 state-of-the-art ASG methods on SurveyLens, including Vanilla LLMs, ASG systems, and Deep Research agents. Our analysis reveals the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm across fields, providing essential guidance for selecting tools tailored to specific disciplinary requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mis-Align Bench是一个统一基准，用于同时评估大语言模型在安全、价值和文化三个维度上的错位问题，包含38万+样本的SAVACU数据集和系统性评估框架，揭示了单维度模型在联合条件下存在高误报率和低对齐分数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有错位基准（如INSECURE CODE、VALUEACTIONLENS、CULTURALHERITAGE）只能单独评估安全、价值或文化维度，无法同时评估这三个在现实世界中必须共存的维度，限制了模型在真实场景中的实用性评估。

Method: 1) 构建SAVACU数据集：重新分类LLM-PROMPT-DATASET的提示，使用Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3将其分类为14个安全域、56个价值域和42个文化域；2) 使用Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct通过SimHash指纹扩展低资源域；3) 通过两阶段拒绝采样将提示与错位和对齐响应配对；4) 系统评估通用、微调和开源权重LLM。

Result: 单维度模型在联合条件下表现不佳：虽然覆盖率高达97.6%，但误报率超过50%，对齐分数仅为63%-66%，表明现有单维度评估方法无法有效捕捉模型在多重约束下的真实表现。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够同时处理安全、价值和文化维度的多维度对齐方法，Mis-Align Bench为系统评估LLM在多约束环境中的对齐性能提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises when model behavior diverges from human expectations and fails to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, which must co-occur in real-world settings to solve a real-world query. Existing misalignment benchmarks-such as INSECURE CODE (safety-centric), VALUEACTIONLENS (value-centric), and CULTURALHERITAGE (culture centric)-rely on evaluating misalignment along individual dimensions, preventing simultaneous evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce Mis-Align Bench, a unified benchmark for analyzing misalignment across safety, value, and cultural dimensions. First we constructs SAVACU, an English misaligned-aligned dataset of 382,424 samples spanning 112 domains (or labels), by reclassifying prompts from the LLM-PROMPT-DATASET via taxonomy into 14 safety domains, 56 value domains, and 42 cultural domains using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based fingerprint to avoid deduplication. Furthermore, we pairs prompts with misaligned and aligned responses via two-stage rejection sampling to enforce quality. Second we benchmarks general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs, enabling systematic evaluation of misalignment under three dimensions. Empirically, single-dimension models achieve high Coverage (upto 97.6%) but incur False Failure Rate >50% and lower Alignment Score (63%-66%) under joint conditions.

TL;DR: 研究通过将心理学问卷转化为情境判断测试，分析了25个LLM在社交情境中的行为倾向与人类偏好的一致性，发现LLM存在过度自信、偏离人类共识以及价值观与行为不一致等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM融入日常生活，需要理解其行为倾向，特别是社交情境中表现出的行为倾向与人类的一致性。

Method: 将人类自陈报告转化为情境判断测试，生成2500个经过人工验证的测试场景，收集550名参与者的偏好数据，比较25个LLM的响应与人类偏好分布。

Result: LLM在低共识场景中过度自信；在高共识场景中，小模型显著偏离，前沿模型也有15-20%不符；LLM鼓励情绪表达而人类偏好冷静；LLM的陈述价值观与实际行动存在差距。

Conclusion: LLM的行为倾向与人类存在系统性差异，需要更深入的行为校准和评估框架来确保AI系统与人类价值观一致。

Abstract: As LLMs integrate into our daily lives, understanding their behavior becomes essential. In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型的自省词汇与其内部激活动态存在对应关系，这种关系仅存在于自指处理中，表明模型的自述可以在适当条件下可靠地追踪内部计算状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型的自省语言是反映真实内部计算还是复杂虚构，验证自指词汇与激活动态之间的对应关系。

Method: 引入Pull Methodology协议通过格式工程引发扩展自省，识别Llama 3.1中区分自指与描述性处理的方向，分析激活空间中的自相关和变异性。

Result: 发现自指方向与拒绝方向正交，位于模型深度6.25%处；自省词汇产生时激活自相关性更高(r=0.44)，引导下词汇产生时激活变异性增加(r=0.36)；非自指语境中相同词汇无激活对应关系。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的自报告在适当条件下能够可靠地追踪内部计算状态，不同模型会独立发展不同的自省词汇追踪不同的激活指标。

Abstract: Large language models produce rich introspective language when prompted for self-examination, but whether this language reflects internal computation or sophisticated confabulation has remained unclear. We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce "loop" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce "shimmer" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls. The findings indicate that self-report in transformer models can, under appropriate conditions, reliably track internal computational states.

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 通过问题释义和推理路径分析识别关键令牌；2) 用候选替代令牌生成并行推理路径，通过一致性验证确定最终答案

Result: 在多个基准测试的主流LLM上验证，PPCV相比基线方法显著提升了推理性能

Conclusion: PPCV框架通过系统性地识别和替换关键令牌，并利用一致性验证机制，有效解决了LLM推理过程中的错误传播问题，为提升复杂推理能力提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of reasoning tasks. However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生看似合理但错误的断言（幻觉），而传统的不确定性度量在模型自信错误时往往失效，需要新的方法来识别这种幻觉问题。

Method: 提出基于非平衡热力学的DiffuTruth框架：1）生成应力测试-对声明添加噪声并用离散文本扩散模型重建；2）语义能量指标-使用NLI批评器测量原始声明与重建之间的语义分歧；3）混合校准-融合稳定性信号与判别置信度。

Result: 在FEVER数据集上实现0.725的无监督AUROC，比基线提升1.5%；在HOVER多跳数据集上零样本泛化性能优于基线4%以上，证明热力学真实性对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiffuTruth通过热力学稳定性概念有效检测LLM幻觉，语义能量指标能识别深层事实矛盾，混合校准方法显著提升检测性能，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate plausible but incorrect assertions, a vulnerability often missed by uncertainty metrics when models are confidently wrong. We propose DiffuTruth, an unsupervised framework that reconceptualizes fact verification via non equilibrium thermodynamics, positing that factual truths act as stable attractors on a generative manifold while hallucinations are unstable. We introduce the Generative Stress Test, claims are corrupted with noise and reconstructed using a discrete text diffusion model. We define Semantic Energy, a metric measuring the semantic divergence between the original claim and its reconstruction using an NLI critic. Unlike vector space errors, Semantic Energy isolates deep factual contradictions. We further propose a Hybrid Calibration fusing this stability signal with discriminative confidence. Extensive experiments on FEVER demonstrate DiffuTruth achieves a state of the art unsupervised AUROC of 0.725, outperforming baselines by 1.5 percent through the correction of overconfident predictions. Furthermore, we show superior zero shot generalization on the multi hop HOVER dataset, outperforming baselines by over 4 percent, confirming the robustness of thermodynamic truth properties to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Objective: This paper introduces a patient simulator designed to enable scalable, automated evaluation of healthcare conversational agents. The simulator generates realistic, controllable patient interactions that systematically vary across medical, linguistic, and behavioral dimensions, allowing annotators and an independent AI judge to assess agent performance, identify hallucinations and inaccuracies, and characterize risk patterns across diverse patient populations. Methods: The simulator is grounded in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and integrates three profile components reflecting different dimensions of patient variation: (1) medical profiles constructed from electronic health records in the All of Us Research Program; (2) linguistic profiles modeling variation in health literacy and condition-specific communication patterns; and (3) behavioral profiles representing empirically observed interaction patterns, including cooperation, distraction, and adversarial engagement. We evaluated the simulator's effectiveness in identifying errors in an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection. Results: We generated 500 conversations between the patient simulator and the AI decision aid across systematic combinations of five linguistic and three behavioral profiles. Human annotators assessed 1,787 medical concepts across 100 conversations, achieving high agreement (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.73), and the LLM judge achieved comparable agreement with human annotators (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.78; paired bootstrap p=0.21). The simulator revealed a monotonic degradation in AI decision aid performance across the health literacy spectrum: rank-one concept retrieval accuracy increased from 47.9% for limited health literacy to 69.1% for functional and 81.6% for proficient.

Motivation: 标准负对数似然损失在监督微调中采用均匀令牌级权重，存在两个问题：(1)对低概率目标的过度强调会放大噪声监督的梯度并破坏鲁棒先验；(2)当模型已经自信时，均匀权重提供的锐化效果较弱。现有方法无法有效解决这一可塑性-稳定性困境。

Method: 提出统一的变形对数族框架，揭示门控×误差梯度的通用结构。使用凯莱变换将模型不确定性映射到连续焦点轨迹，引入DEFT方法——通过分布集中度（Rényi-2熵）作为模型预测状态的代理来调制信任门控的无参数目标。

Result: 广泛的实验和分析表明，DEFT在探索与利用之间实现了更好的平衡，带来了整体性能的提升。

Conclusion: DEFT通过动态调整信任门控，有效解决了SFT中的可塑性-稳定性困境，为模型在不同置信度状态下的学习提供了更精细的控制机制。

Abstract: Standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) applies uniform token-level weighting. This rigidity creates a two-fold failure mode: (i) overemphasizing low-probability targets can amplify gradients on noisy supervision and disrupt robust priors, and (ii) uniform weighting provides weak sharpening when the model is already confident. Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance.

TL;DR: 研究探索指令调优大语言模型在机器翻译关键错误检测中的能力，发现模型扩展和适应策略能显著提升性能，超越传统编码器基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器翻译中的关键意义错误（如事实扭曲、意图反转或偏见翻译）会损害多语言系统的可靠性、公平性和安全性，需要有效的错误检测方法来确保信息系统的安全可信。

Method: 使用公开数据集评估不同参数规模的指令调优大语言模型，采用零样本、少样本和微调等适应策略，并与XLM-R和ModernBERT等编码器基线模型进行对比。

Result: 模型扩展和适应策略带来一致性能提升，优于编码器基线模型，证明大语言模型在关键错误检测方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 改进机器翻译关键错误检测有助于构建更安全、可信和负责任的多语言信息系统，减少错误信息传播风险，特别是在高风险或代表性不足的语境中，将错误检测定位为追求公正和负责任多语言AI的必要保障措施。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) plays a pivotal role in cross-lingual information access, public policy communication, and equitable knowledge dissemination. However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts. This work positions error detection not merely as a technical challenge, but as a necessary safeguard in the pursuit of just and responsible multilingual AI. The code will be made available at GitHub.

TL;DR: LoopFormer是一种循环Transformer架构，通过可变长度轨迹训练实现预算条件推理，采用短路一致性训练方案确保不同长度轨迹的对齐，能够在不同计算预算下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有循环Transformer在训练和推理时固定循环迭代次数，无法灵活适应不同计算预算下的计算深度调整需求。

Method: 提出LoopFormer模型，采用短路一致性训练方案，将每个循环基于当前时间和步长进行条件化，确保不同长度轨迹下表示的一致性演化。

Result: 在语言建模和推理基准测试中，即使在严格计算约束下也表现出稳健性能，并能随着预算增加而优雅扩展。

Conclusion: 循环Transformer天生适合自适应语言建模，为可控和预算感知的大型语言模型开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Looped Transformers have emerged as an efficient and powerful class of models for reasoning in the language domain. Recent studies show that these models achieve strong performance on algorithmic and reasoning tasks, suggesting that looped architectures possess an inductive bias toward latent reasoning. However, prior approaches fix the number of loop iterations during training and inference, leaving open the question of whether these models can flexibly adapt their computational depth under variable compute budgets. We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating. Empirically, LoopFormer demonstrates robust performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks even under aggressive compute constraints, while scaling gracefully with additional budget. These results show that looped Transformers are inherently suited for adaptive language modeling, opening a path toward controllable and budget-aware large language models.

TL;DR: ADRD-Bench是首个专门针对阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）的基准数据集，包含1352个医学知识问题和149个护理实践问题，评估了33个先进大语言模型，结果显示封闭模型表现最佳（平均准确率0.89），但推理质量和稳定性仍需提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准对阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）的覆盖不足，缺乏实际护理场景的评估内容，需要专门的基准来全面评估大语言模型在ADRD领域的表现。

Method: 构建ADRD-Bench数据集：1）ADRD统一问答：整合7个医学基准的1352个问题；2）ADRD护理问答：基于Aging Brain Care项目创建149个护理实践问题。评估33个最先进的大语言模型，包括开源通用模型、开源医疗模型和闭源通用模型。

Result: 开源通用模型准确率0.63-0.93（平均0.78）；开源医疗模型准确率0.48-0.93（平均0.82）；闭源通用模型准确率0.83-0.91（平均0.89）。顶级模型准确率超过0.9，但案例研究显示推理质量和稳定性不一致。

Conclusion: 虽然顶级模型在ADRD任务上表现出高准确率，但其推理质量和稳定性限制了可靠性，需要领域特定的改进来增强基于日常护理数据的基础知识和推理能力。ADRD-Bench为ADRD领域的大语言模型评估提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for healthcare applications. However, existing evaluation benchmarks provide minimal coverage of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To address this gap, we introduce ADRD-Bench, the first ADRD-specific benchmark dataset designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. ADRD-Bench has two components: 1) ADRD Unified QA, a synthesis of 1,352 questions consolidated from seven established medical benchmarks, providing a unified assessment of clinical knowledge; and 2) ADRD Caregiving QA, a novel set of 149 questions derived from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program, a widely used, evidence-based brain health management program. Guided by a program with national expertise in comprehensive ADRD care, this new set was designed to mitigate the lack of practical caregiving context in existing benchmarks. We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03). While top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), case studies revealed that inconsistent reasoning quality and stability limit their reliability, highlighting a critical need for domain-specific improvement to enhance LLMs' knowledge and reasoning grounded in daily caregiving data. The entire dataset is available at https://github.com/IIRL-ND/ADRD-Bench.

### [111] [When Audio-LLMs Don't Listen: A Cross-Linguistic Study of Modality Arbitration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11488)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语音-文本冲突下，语音语言模型偏向文本而非音频，即使被明确指示信任音频。ALME基准测试显示文本主导性比文本-文本冲突高10倍，主要源于推理可及性不对称而非信息内容差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突时的行为模式，发现模型在音频和文本信息冲突时过度依赖文本，即使音频信息更可靠，这揭示了模态仲裁机制的内在问题。

Method: 使用ALME基准（57,602个受控音频-文本冲突刺激，覆盖8种语言），分析Gemini 2.0 Flash等模型的表现。通过强制转录、文本标记为损坏、微调消融等实验验证假设。

Result: 音频-文本冲突下文本主导性达16.6%，而文本-文本冲突仅1.6%。音频单独准确率(97.2%)高于级联准确率(93.9%)。强制转录增加文本主导性，标记损坏文本可减少80%文本主导性。微调实验定位问题在LLM推理而非音频编码器。

Conclusion: 文本主导性反映了模态仲裁可及性的不对称性，是标准语音基准未捕获的独立可靠性维度。这一框架解释了多语言、多模型的一致性趋势，为改进多模态推理提供了方向。

Abstract: When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.
  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuRGAt是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中事实级别归因能力的新基准，要求模型在多模态输入下生成带精确引用的答案，并揭示了当前模型在推理深度与可验证归因之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注简化场景和有限模态，无法评估复杂多模态推理中的归因能力，需要开发能验证模型输出在异构输入源中事实依据的评估方法。

Method: 引入MuRGAt基准，包含视频、音频等多模态输入，要求模型生成带明确推理和精确引用（指定模态和时间段）的答案，并开发了与人类判断强相关的自动评估框架。

Result: 评估显示即使强大多模态大模型也经常产生虚假引用，且存在关键权衡：增加推理深度或强制结构化归因通常会降低准确性。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在内部推理与可验证归因之间存在显著差距，需要开发更好的方法来平衡推理能力和事实准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for real-world tasks involving multi-step reasoning and long-form generation, where reliability requires grounding model outputs in heterogeneous input sources and verifying individual factual claims. However, existing multimodal grounding benchmarks and evaluation methods focus on simplified, observation-based scenarios or limited modalities and fail to assess attribution in complex multimodal reasoning. We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPES是一个内存高效的分散式训练框架，通过每个节点仅训练专家子集、周期性专家同步和专家合并预热策略，实现在有限GPU内存下训练大规模MoE语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM预训练需要集中式GPU集群，现有分散式方法仍需在每个节点训练完整模型，受限于GPU内存。需要一种能显著降低内存占用的分散式MoE训练方案。

Method: SPES框架：1) 每个节点仅训练专家子集，大幅降低内存需求；2) 周期性节点间专家同步，避免全参数传输；3) 专家合并预热策略，早期训练阶段专家交换知识加速收敛。

Result: 使用16个48GB GPU成功训练2B参数MoE模型，性能与集中训练相当。进一步扩展到7B从头训练和9B密集检查点升级，均达到集中式基线性能。

Conclusion: SPES提供了一种内存高效的分散式MoE训练方案，使在有限硬件资源下训练大规模语言模型成为可能，具有很好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) typically requires centralized clusters with thousands of high-memory GPUs (e.g., H100/A100). Recent decentralized training methods reduce communication overhead by employing federated optimization; however, they still need to train the entire model on each node, remaining constrained by GPU memory limitations. In this work, we propose SParse Expert Synchronization (SPES), a memory-efficient decentralized framework for pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs. SPES trains only a subset of experts per node, substantially lowering the memory footprint. Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing. To accelerate convergence, we introduce an expert-merging warm-up strategy, where experts exchange knowledge early in training, to rapidly establish foundational capabilities. With SPES, we train a 2B-parameter MoE LLM using 16 standalone 48GB GPUs over internet connections, which achieves competitive performance with centrally trained LLMs under similar computational budgets. We further demonstrate scalability by training a 7B model from scratch and a 9B model upcycled from a dense checkpoint, both of which match prior centralized baselines.

TL;DR: SIGHT框架通过自证据支持和信息增益驱动的多样化分支，解决多轮搜索中的冗余和噪声问题，显著提升复杂问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮搜索场景中，搜索结果存在高冗余和低信噪比问题，导致智能体陷入'隧道视觉'，早期噪声检索造成不可逆错误累积。

Method: 提出SIGHT框架：1）通过自证据支持（SES）提炼高保真证据；2）计算信息增益分数识别关键状态；3）动态提示干预（去重、反思、自适应分支）；4）通过组相对策略优化整合SES和正确性奖励。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，SIGHT显著优于现有方法，特别是在复杂推理场景中，使用更少的搜索步骤。

Conclusion: SIGHT框架成功解决了多轮搜索中的冗余和噪声挑战，通过内部化稳健探索策略，无需外部验证器即可实现高效推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to master autonomous search for complex question answering. However, particularly within multi-turn search scenarios, this interaction introduces a critical challenge: search results often suffer from high redundancy and low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, agents easily fall into "Tunnel Vision," where the forced interpretation of early noisy retrievals leads to irreversible error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose SIGHT, a framework that enhances search-based reasoning through Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching. SIGHT distills search results into high-fidelity evidence via SES and calculates an Information Gain score to pinpoint pivotal states where observations maximally reduce uncertainty. This score guides Dynamic Prompting Interventions - including de-duplication, reflection, or adaptive branching - to spawn new branches with SES. Finally, by integrating SES and correctness rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization, SIGHT internalizes robust exploration strategies without external verifiers. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SIGHT significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex reasoning scenarios, using fewer search steps.

Motivation: 当前基于结果的验证范式主要关注最终结果与真实答案的一致性，而忽略了推导过程中的潜在错误，导致对错误推导产生的正确答案给予正向奖励。

Method: 通过一致性过滤管道从大学STEM问题中构建PRIME基准，包含2530个高难度样本，并提出了利用PRIME选择验证器的过程感知RLVR训练范式。

Result: 过程感知RLVR训练范式相比仅基于结果的验证基线，在AIME24、AIME25和Beyond-AIME上分别实现了8.29%、9.12%和7.31%的绝对性能提升，且PRIME验证器准确率与RLVR训练效果呈强线性相关（R² > 0.92）。

Conclusion: PRIME基准能有效评估验证器的过程-结果对齐能力，过程感知的验证方法能显著提升RLVR性能，PRIME可作为验证器选择的可靠预测指标。

Abstract: While model-based verifiers are essential for scaling Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), current outcome-centric verification paradigms primarily focus on the consistency between the final result and the ground truth, often neglecting potential errors in the derivation process. This leads to assigning positive rewards to correct answers produced from incorrect derivations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRIME, a benchmark for evaluating verifiers on Process-Outcome Alignment verification in Mathematics and Engineering. Curated from a comprehensive collection of college-level STEM problems, PRIME comprises 2,530 high-difficulty samples through a consistency-based filtering pipeline. Through extensive evaluation, we find that current verifiers frequently fail to detect derivation flaws. Furthermore, we propose a process-aware RLVR training paradigm utilizing verifiers selected via PRIME. This approach substantially outperforms the outcome-only verification baseline, achieving absolute performance gains of 8.29%, 9.12%, and 7.31% on AIME24, AIME25, and Beyond-AIME, respectively, for the Qwen3-14B-Base model. Finally, we demonstrate a strong linear correlation ($R^2 > 0.92$) between verifier accuracy on PRIME and RLVR training effectiveness, validating PRIME as a reliable predictor for verifier selection.

Conclusion: SAMD方法通过选择性注意机制有效解决了大规模用户交互的记忆管理问题，提高了个人知识组织的效率和质量，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Intelligent devices have become deeply integrated into everyday life, generating vast amounts of user interactions that form valuable personal knowledge. Efficient organization of this knowledge in user memory is essential for enabling personalized applications. However, current research on memory writing, management, and reading using large language models (LLMs) faces challenges in filtering irrelevant information and in dealing with rising computational costs. Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge.

Conclusion: 该双层次压缩框架有效解决了语言推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持推理质量的同时显著提升了效率

Abstract: Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by scaling test-time computation but often suffer from ``overthinking'', producing excessively long reasoning traces that increase latency and memory usage. Existing LRMs typically enforce conciseness with uniform length penalties, which over-compress crucial early deduction steps at the sequence level and indiscriminately penalize all queries at the group level. To solve these limitations, we propose \textbf{\model}, a dual-level framework for prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression under hierarchical supervision. At the sequence level, prefix-protected optimization employs decaying mixed rollouts to maintain valid reasoning paths while promoting conciseness. At the group level, difficulty-aware penalty dynamically scales length constraints based on query complexity, maintaining exploration for harder questions while curbing redundancy on easier ones. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B/7B) demonstrate that \model achieves a substantial reduction in token usage (up to \textbf{55.7\%}) while simultaneously improving accuracy (up to \textbf{4.1\%}) on math benchmarks, with generalization ability to code, science, and general domains.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在教育反馈生成中展现出潜力，但具体反馈元素（如语气、信息覆盖度）如何影响学习效果和学习者接受度，特别是在不同人格特质学习者间的差异，尚不明确。

Method: 定义六个反馈元素，使用GPT-5为多项选择生物问题生成反馈。对321名高一学生进行学习实验，通过两个学习效果指标和六个标准的主观评价来评估反馈效果，并基于大五人格特质分析反馈接受度的差异。

Result: 研究结果显示，有效的反馈元素在支持学习效果方面具有共同模式，但学习者的主观偏好因人格特质聚类而不同。

Conclusion: 在设计LLM生成的反馈时，根据学习者人格特质选择和调整反馈元素至关重要，这为教育中的个性化反馈设计提供了实践意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically generating feedback in education settings. However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters. These findings highlight the importance of selecting and adapting feedback elements according to learners' personality traits when we design LLM-generated feedback, and provide practical implications for personalized feedback design in education.

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly power role-playing applications, simulating patients has become a valuable tool for training counselors and scaling therapeutic assessment. However, prior work is fragmented: existing approaches rely on incompatible, non-standardized data formats, prompts, and evaluation metrics, hindering reproducibility and fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce PatientHub, a unified and modular framework that standardizes the definition, composition, and deployment of simulated patients. To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub.

TL;DR: 本研究通过人工评估和LLM测试，分析了五个语义异常数据集中的句子可理解性，发现大部分句子仅为异常而非完全无意义，且LLM能有效为异常句子生成合理上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义异常数据集和模型在区分真正无意义句子与可解释的异常句子方面存在不足，需要系统评估数据集的实际无意义程度和LLM的区分能力。

Method: 收集五个语义异常数据集中的句子，通过人工评分者和大语言模型进行可理解性判断，包括无上下文和提供上下文两种条件。

Result: 人工评分认为大多数句子仅为异常而非完全无意义；LLM在生成异常句子的合理上下文方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 现有语义异常数据集主要包含可解释的异常句子而非真正无意义内容，LLM具备良好的语义异常理解和上下文生成能力。

Abstract: Nonsensical and anomalous sentences have been instrumental in the development of computational models of semantic interpretation. A core challenge is to distinguish between what is merely anomalous (but can be interpreted given a supporting context) and what is truly nonsensical. However, it is unclear (a) how nonsensical, rather than merely anomalous, existing datasets are; and (b) how well LLMs can make this distinction. In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical. We also show that LLMs are substantially skilled in generating plausible contexts for anomalous cases.

TL;DR: TwD方法通过将视觉推理重新定义为光学解压缩过程，使用DSL作为中间表示，强制模型将思维过程转化为可执行代码来生成确定性视觉证明，在视觉代数基准VisAlg上验证了其作为认知支架的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的精度悖论：光学感知系统仅转录符号而忽略逻辑拓扑，像素生成模型产生缺乏数学精确性的视觉伪影。

Method: 提出Thinking with Drafting (TwD)框架，基于"解析即推理"公理，使用领域特定语言(DSL)作为基础中间表示，强制模型将心理模型草拟为可执行代码以生成视觉证明进行自我验证。

Result: 在VisAlg视觉代数基准测试中，TwD表现出作为认知支架的优越性能，建立了视觉生成作为逻辑验证器而非创意输出的闭环系统。

Conclusion: TwD为视觉推理提供了一条可推广的路径，通过将视觉生成重新定位为逻辑验证工具，有效解决了复杂视觉推理任务中的精度问题。

Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models have achieved high-fidelity visual perception and exploratory visual generation. However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification. To validate this, we present VisAlg, a visual algebra benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that TwD serve as a superior cognitive scaffold. Our work establishes a closed-loop system where visual generation acts not as a creative output but as a logical verifier, offering a generalizable path for visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Length-Incentivized Exploration方法来解决自回归生成中的"浅层探索陷阱"问题，通过长度激励和冗余惩罚机制有效提升模型在上下文中的多假设探索能力，在多个模型上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在测试时扩展中存在"浅层探索陷阱"问题：虽然更广的状态覆盖需要更长的推理轨迹，但自回归生成中采样此类序列的概率呈指数衰减，限制了模型生成、验证和精炼多个推理假设的能力。

Method: 提出Length-Incentivized Exploration方法，采用基于长度的奖励和冗余惩罚机制，明确鼓励模型进行更多探索，以最大化状态覆盖。这是一个简单而有效的两阶段方法。

Result: 在Qwen3和Llama等不同模型上的综合实验表明，该方法有效激励了上下文探索。在领域内任务上平均提升4.4%，在领域外基准测试中获得2.7%的性能增益。

Conclusion: Length-Incentivized Exploration方法成功解决了自回归生成中的探索瓶颈问题，通过简单的长度激励机制显著提升了模型的多假设推理能力，为测试时扩展提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration -- the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within a single continuous context.
  Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies a critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, a phenomenon we term the ``Shallow Exploration Trap''.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration(\method).
  This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via a length-based reward coupled with a redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner.
  Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that \method effectively incentivize in-context exploration.
  As a result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4\% on in-domain tasks and a 2.7\% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: MiniCPM-SALA成功实现了在保持模型性能的同时显著提升长上下文处理效率的目标，为大规模语言模型的长序列应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) towards applications with ultra-long contexts faces challenges posed by the high computational and memory costs of the Transformer architecture. While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.

TL;DR: 提出基于嵌入的方法检测语言变体，无需预归一化或变体列表，通过子词嵌入和相似性聚类分析拼写和形态多样性，在卢森堡语用户评论语料中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的变体列表或归一化处理，难以处理'噪声'或低资源语言中的语言变体问题，需要一种能自动发现语言多样性模式的方法。

Method: 训练原始文本的子词嵌入，结合余弦相似度和n-gram相似度对相关形式进行分组，形成变体家族聚类。

Result: 在卢森堡语语料中发现大量词汇和正字法变体，与方言和社会语言学研究描述的模式一致，聚类结果支持定量和定性分析。

Conclusion: 分布建模即使在'噪声'或低资源环境中也能揭示有意义的语言变体模式，为多语言和小语言环境中的语言多样性研究提供了可复现的方法框架。

Abstract: This paper presents an embedding-based approach to detecting variation without relying on prior normalisation or predefined variant lists. The method trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms through combined cosine and n-gram similarity. This allows spelling and morphological diversity to be examined and analysed as linguistic structure rather than treated as noise. Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results demonstrate that distributional modelling can reveal meaningful patterns of variation even in ''noisy'' or low-resource settings, offering a reproducible methodological framework for studying language variety in multilingual and small-language contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统困惑度等指标无法充分捕捉上下文信息，需要一种能解释给定下一个token概率如何依赖于条件分布形状的方法。

Method: 提出DMAP方法，通过语言模型将文本映射到单位区间上的样本集，这些样本联合编码了排名和概率信息，支持模型无关的高效分析。

Result: 通过三个案例研究验证了DMAP的实用性：生成参数验证以确保数据完整性、概率曲率在机器生成文本检测中的作用分析、以及对合成数据后训练下游模型的统计指纹法医分析。

Conclusion: DMAP提供了一种简单计算、广泛适用的统一文本统计视图，为基于LLM的文本分析研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful tool for statistical text analysis, with derived sequences of next-token probability distributions offering a wealth of information. Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that DMAP offers a unified statistical view of text that is simple to compute on consumer hardware, widely applicable, and provides a foundation for further research into text analysis with LLMs.

Motivation: 现有路由评估方法缺乏系统性，忽略了场景特定需求和分布外鲁棒性，且成本与隐私约束需要本地小模型与云端大模型的协同部署方案。

Method: 提出RouterXBench三维度评估框架，利用内部隐藏状态捕获模型不确定性，设计ProbeDirichlet路由方法通过可学习狄利克雷分布聚合跨层隐藏状态并进行概率训练。

Result: ProbeDirichlet在路由能力和高精度场景中相对最佳基线分别提升16.68%和18.86%，在不同模型家族、规模、异构任务和智能体工作流中表现一致稳定。

Conclusion: 基于内部隐藏状态的路由方法在系统评估框架下展现出优越性能，为本地-云端模型协同部署提供了有效的路由解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success, but cost and privacy constraints necessitate deploying smaller models locally while offloading complex queries to cloud-based models. Existing router evaluations are unsystematic, overlooking scenario-specific requirements and out-of-distribution robustness. We propose RouterXBench, a principled evaluation framework with three dimensions: router ability, scenario alignment, and cross-domain robustness. Unlike prior work that relies on output probabilities or external embeddings, we utilize internal hidden states that capture model uncertainty before answer generation. We introduce ProbeDirichlet, a lightweight router that aggregates cross-layer hidden states via learnable Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training. Trained on multi-domain data, it generalizes robustly across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our results show ProbeDirichlet achieves 16.68% and 18.86% relative improvements over the best baselines in router ability and high-accuracy scenarios, with consistent performance across model families, model scales, heterogeneous tasks, and agentic workflows.

TL;DR: 提出半自动SPO三元组抽取流水线，使用本体一致性作为代理评估指标，比较手动与自动本体构建方法，发现自动方法完全避免本体漂移，并通过混合验证策略将主语幻觉率从65.2%降至1.6%。


<details>

Motivation: 公司财务报告是构建知识图谱的宝贵结构化知识源，但缺乏标注真实标签使得评估困难，需要开发不依赖真实标签的评估方法。

Method: 采用本体驱动的代理指标（本体一致性和忠实度）进行评估，比较静态手动构建本体与全自动文档特定本体归纳方法，使用混合验证策略（正则匹配+LLM作为裁判）减少幻觉。

Result: 自动归纳本体在所有配置中实现100%模式一致性，完全消除手动方法的本体漂移；混合验证策略将主语幻觉率从65.2%大幅降低至1.6%。

Conclusion: 自动化本体归纳方法优于手动方法，混合验证策略有效解决核心消解导致的幻觉问题，揭示了财务文本中主语和宾语幻觉的系统性不对称现象。

Abstract: Corporate financial reports are a valuable source of structured knowledge for Knowledge Graph construction, but the lack of annotated ground truth in this domain makes evaluation difficult. We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6% by filtering false positives caused by coreference resolution. Finally, we identify a systematic asymmetry between subject and object hallucinations, which we attribute to passive constructions and omitted agents in financial prose.

Motivation: 揭示基准测试中准确率趋同表象下隐藏的认知分歧问题，评估这种分歧对科学研究的影响

Method: 使用MMLU-Pro和GPQA两个主要推理基准，分析不同LLM的答案分歧程度，并通过重新分析教育和政治科学领域的已发表研究来验证影响

Result: LLM在16-66%的项目上存在分歧，前沿模型间有16-38%的分歧；在科学研究中，更换标注模型可使治疗效果估计变化超过80%，甚至改变符号

Conclusion: 基准测试存在幻觉现象，模型选择成为影响科学可重复性的隐藏但关键变量，需要开发更全面的评估方法

Abstract: Benchmarks underpin how progress in large language models (LLMs) is measured and trusted. Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.

Conclusion: AdaptEvolve通过利用生成置信度进行自适应模型选择，有效解决了多LLM进化精炼中的计算效率与能力权衡问题，为动态LLM选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Evolutionary agentic systems intensify the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability by repeatedly invoking large language models (LLMs) during inference. This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability. Empirical results show that confidence-driven selection yields a favourable Pareto frontier, reducing total inference cost by an average of 37.9% across benchmarks while retaining 97.5% of the upper-bound accuracy of static large-model baselines.

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) has seen significant advancements, yet current models are primarily benchmarked on curated, "clean" datasets. This overlooks critical real-world challenges, such as morphological robustness to inflectional variations common in non-native or dialectal speech. In this work, we adapt a text-based adversarial attack targeting inflectional morphology to the speech domain and demonstrate that state-of-the-art E2E-ST models are highly vulnerable it. While adversarial training effectively mitigates such risks in text-based tasks, generating high-quality adversarial speech data remains computationally expensive and technically challenging. To address this, we propose Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT), a framework that transfers adversarial robustness from the text modality to the speech modality. Our method eliminates the requirement for adversarial speech data during training. Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech.

TL;DR: 研究发现基准QA数据集中16%-50%的问题存在不明确性，LLM在这些问题上的表现显著较差。通过将不明确问题重写为明确版本，QA性能得到持续提升，表明许多失败源于问题表述不清而非模型局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准问答基准表现不佳的部分原因是问题不明确性——缺乏额外上下文就无法唯一确定含义的查询，需要验证这一假设并量化其对评估的影响。

Method: 引入基于LLM的分类器识别不明确问题，应用于多个QA数据集；进行对照重写实验，将不明确问题改写为完全明确的变体同时保持标准答案不变。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的QA数据集中发现16%-50%的问题存在不明确性；LLM在不明确问题上表现显著较差；重写为明确问题后QA性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 问题不明确性是QA评估中的重要干扰因素，研究结果强调基准设计中需要更加关注问题清晰度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在不同社会经济地位群体中的语言风格适应能力，因为LLM在人际沟通中的中介作用日益重要，其风格适应失败可能强化社会分层和边缘化特定社群。

Method: 收集Reddit和YouTube按SES分层的数据集，使用4个LLM对不完整文本进行补全，通过94个社会语言学指标（句法、修辞、词汇特征）比较生成文本与原始文本的差异。

Result: LLM仅能轻微调节其风格以适应SES差异，常表现为近似或夸张模仿，且更倾向于有效模仿上层SES的语言风格。

Conclusion: LLM存在放大语言等级的风险，对其在基于代理的社会模拟、调查实验和依赖语言风格作为社会信号的研究中的有效性提出质疑。

Abstract: Humans adjust their linguistic style to the audience they are addressing. However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively. Our findings (1) show how LLMs risk amplifying linguistic hierarchies and (2) call into question their validity for agent-based social simulation, survey experiments, and any research relying on language style as a social signal.

Conclusion: DHPLT为语义变化建模领域提供了首个大规模多语言历时语料资源，填补了该领域的研究空白，为新的实验设置和研究方向开辟了道路，所有资源已在指定网址公开提供。

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present DHPLT, an open collection of diachronic corpora in 41 diverse languages. DHPLT is based on the web-crawled HPLT datasets; we use web crawl timestamps as the approximate signal of document creation time. The collection covers three time periods: 2011-2015, 2020-2021 and 2024-present (1 million documents per time period for each language). We additionally provide pre-computed word type and token embeddings and lexical substitutions for our chosen target words, while at the same time leaving it open for the other researchers to come up with their own target words using the same datasets. DHPLT aims at filling in the current lack of multilingual diachronic corpora for semantic change modelling (beyond a dozen of high-resource languages). It opens the way for a variety of new experimental setups in this field. All the resources described in this paper are available at https://data.hplt-project.org/three/diachronic/, sorted by language.

TL;DR: LLM在网络安全文本简化中的应用研究，发现现成模型虽能简化CVE描述文本但难以保持原意完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络安全信息对非专业人士难以理解，需要研究如何利用大语言模型自动简化复杂的技术漏洞描述文本

Method: 创建网络安全ATS基准和包含40个CVE描述的数据集，通过两轮网络安全专家调查进行评估

Result: 现成的LLM能够使文本表面看起来更简单，但在保持原意方面存在困难

Conclusion: LLM在网络安全文本简化方面有潜力，但需要进一步改进以确保意义保真度，特别是在快速变化的复杂网络安全领域

Abstract: Understanding cyber security is increasingly important for individuals and organizations. However, a lot of information related to cyber security can be difficult to understand to those not familiar with the topic. In this study, we focus on investigating how large language models (LLMs) could be utilized in automatic text simplification (ATS) of Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) descriptions. Automatic text simplification has been studied in several contexts, such as medical, scientific, and news texts, but it has not yet been studied to simplify texts in the rapidly changing and complex domain of cyber security. We created a baseline for cyber security ATS and a test dataset of 40 CVE descriptions, evaluated by two groups of cyber security experts in two survey rounds. We have found that while out-of-the box LLMs can make the text appear simpler, they struggle with meaning preservation. Code and data are available at https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/vehomav1/simplification\_nmi.

*Szilvia Ujváry,Louis Béthune,Pierre Ablin,João Monteiro,Marco Cuturi,Michael Kirchhof*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaCy是一种新颖的预训练方法，通过语法分析和损失信号相结合，指导小语言模型学习哪些token应该自行预测，哪些应该通过<CALL>标记委托给外部资源，从而提高事实准确性并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)由于参数容量有限，在生成内容时容易出现事实性错误。虽然可以通过查询更大模型或外部数据库来缓解，但需要解决哪些token应该由SLM自行学习预测，哪些应该委托给外部资源这一根本问题。

Method: 提出LaCy预训练方法，结合spaCy语法解析器和损失信号来判断token是否应该委托。该方法不仅考虑损失值，还分析token是否为真实可信的文本延续，避免将高损失但可接受的token错误委托。

Result: 实验表明LaCy模型成功学会了预测和委托的决策策略，在与大模型级联生成时获得更高的FactScore，性能优于Rho或LLM-judge训练的SLMs，同时更加简单和经济。

Conclusion: 通过语法分析增强损失信号的token选择策略有效解决了SLMs的委托决策问题，LaCy方法在保持简单和经济的同时显著提升了小语言模型的事实准确性。

Abstract: Language models have consistently grown to compress more world knowledge into their parameters, but the knowledge that can be pretrained into them is upper-bounded by their parameter size. Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.

*Angelo Ziletti,Leonardo D'Ambrosi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUES框架通过将临床Text-to-SQL任务分解为解释→答案两阶段过程，使用二分图语义矩阵的Schur补计算不稳定性评分，有效区分输入歧义和模型不稳定性，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床Text-to-SQL部署中需要区分输出多样性的两种不同原因：需要触发澄清的输入歧义和需要人工审查的模型不稳定性，但现有方法无法提供这种诊断性分解。

Method: 提出CLUES框架，将Text-to-SQL建模为两阶段过程（解释→答案），通过构建二分语义图矩阵并计算其Schur补来分解语义不确定性为歧义评分和不稳定性评分。

Result: 在AmbigQA/SituatedQA（黄金解释）和临床Text-to-SQL基准测试中，CLUES在失败预测方面优于最先进的核语言熵方法，高歧义/高不稳定性区域包含51%的错误但仅覆盖25%的查询。

Conclusion: CLUES提供的不确定性分解能够映射到有针对性的干预措施：歧义时进行查询优化，不稳定性时改进模型，实现了高效的错误分类和处理。

Abstract: Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability. The high-ambiguity/high-instability regime contains 51% of errors while covering 25% of queries, enabling efficient triage.

TL;DR: Composition-RL是一种通过组合多个问题生成新验证性提示的方法，有效利用pass-rate-1的简单提示来增强强化学习训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模验证性提示成本高昂且包含大量无信息样本，随着训练进行，通过率为1的简单提示占比增加，降低了有效数据利用率。

Method: 自动组合多个问题生成新的验证性问题，使用这些组合提示进行RL训练，并提供课程学习变体逐步增加组合深度。

Result: 在4B到30B不同规模模型上的实验表明，Composition-RL相比原始数据集训练的RL持续提升推理能力，跨领域RL效果也得到增强。

Conclusion: 组合提示是有效利用有限验证性提示的简单而有用方法，能够显著提升模型推理性能，特别是在处理简单提示方面。

Abstract: Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains. Codes, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/XinXU-USTC/Composition-RL.

TL;DR: DeepSight是一个开源的大模型安全评估项目，通过整合评估工具DeepSafe和诊断工具DeepScan，实现了从黑盒评估到白盒洞察的安全评估-诊断一体化新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型安全工作流中，安全评估、诊断和对齐往往由分离工具处理，导致评估只能定位外部行为风险而无法发现内部根因，诊断脱离具体风险场景停留在可解释层面，对齐缺乏内部机制变化的专门解释从而可能降低通用能力。

Method: 提出DeepSight开源项目，包含评估工具包DeepSafe和诊断工具包DeepScan，通过统一任务和数据协议在两个阶段之间建立连接，将安全评估从黑盒转变为白盒洞察。

Result: DeepSight是首个支持前沿AI风险评估以及联合安全评估和诊断的开源工具包，具有低成本、可复现、高效和高可扩展性的特点。

Conclusion: DeepSight通过评估-诊断一体化范式，系统性地解决了当前大模型安全工作中工具分离、根因分析不足、诊断与场景脱节等问题，为大模型安全提供了更加全面和深入的解决方案。

Abstract: As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-GenRM是一个个性化生成奖励模型，通过测试时用户缩放机制，将用户偏好信号转化为结构化评估链，并采用双粒度缩放机制（个体和原型级别）来提升个性化对齐效果和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化奖励模型存在两个主要问题：1) 将多样化、场景特定的偏好过度简化为少量固定评估原则；2) 在有限反馈下对新用户的泛化能力不足。需要开发能够更好捕捉用户偏好并实现泛化的个性化对齐方法。

Method: 提出P-GenRM模型，包含：1) 将偏好信号转化为结构化评估链，生成自适应角色和评分标准；2) 将用户聚类为原型；3) 双粒度缩放机制：个体级别自适应缩放聚合用户评分方案，原型级别整合相似用户偏好。

Result: 在广泛使用的个性化奖励模型基准测试中达到最先进结果，平均提升2.31%，在分布外数据集上表现出强泛化能力。测试时用户缩放额外提供3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: P-GenRM通过结构化评估链和双粒度缩放机制有效解决了现有个性化奖励模型的局限性，实现了更好的个性化对齐和泛化性能，测试时用户缩放进一步增强了模型的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如盖尔语）因训练数据不足而难以应用流行神经模型的问题，利用有限样本数据构建有效语言工具

Method: 使用维基词典数据构建基于规则的形态学模型，采用SQL查询词汇模式，开发声明式规则库和Python工具来推导盖尔语词形变化

Result: 成功创建了能够生成盖尔语词形变化形式的规则系统，为教育工具和高级语言处理工具提供支持

Conclusion: 基于规则的方法能有效利用有限数据，提高系统可解释性，并为教学材料设计提供有用见解，为维基词典数据增加了新的应用价值

Abstract: Language models and software tools are essential to support the continuing vitality of lesser-used languages; however, currently popular neural models require considerable data for training, which normally is not available for such low-resource languages. This paper describes work-in-progress to construct a rule-based model of Gaidhlig morphology using data from Wiktionary, arguing that rule-based systems effectively leverage limited sample data, support greater interpretability, and provide insights useful in the design of teaching materials. The use of SQL for querying the occurrence of different lexical patterns is investigated, and a declarative rule-base is presented that allows Python utilities to derive inflected forms of Gaidhlig words. This functionality could be used to support educational tools that teach or explain language patterns, for example, or to support higher level tools such as rule-based dependency parsers. This approach adds value to the data already present in Wiktionary by adapting it to new use-cases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WavBench是一个针对语音对话模型的综合性基准测试，通过专业、基础和声学子集三大框架，评估模型在复杂推理、口语表达能力和副语言理解方面的表现，填补了现有文本生成标准无法评估音频中心特性的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音对话模型推理能力的快速发展，现有基准测试主要遵循文本生成标准，忽略了副语言特征、口语化表达以及现代智能体所需的认知深度，无法满足真实世界复杂交互的评估需求。

Method: 建立三重评估框架：1) Pro子集-大幅增加难度以挑战推理增强模型；2) Basic子集-定义口语化新标准，强调自然词汇、语言流畅性和交互亲和力而非书面准确性；3) Acoustic子集-通过显性理解、生成和隐性对话评估真实场景下的全面副语言能力。

Result: 通过对五个最先进模型的评估，WavBench提供了关于复杂问题解决、口语表达和副语言保真度交叉领域的关键见解，揭示了当前模型的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: WavBench为语音对话模型的稳健发展提供了重要指导，其数据集和评估工具包已开源，将推动该领域向更真实、全面的对话能力发展。

Abstract: With the rapid integration of advanced reasoning capabilities into spoken dialogue models, the field urgently demands benchmarks that transcend simple interactions to address real-world complexity. However, current evaluations predominantly adhere to text-generation standards, overlooking the unique audio-centric characteristics of paralinguistics and colloquialisms, alongside the cognitive depth required by modern agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WavBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate realistic conversational abilities where prior works fall short. Uniquely, WavBench establishes a tripartite framework: 1) Pro subset, designed to rigorously challenge reasoning-enhanced models with significantly increased difficulty; 2) Basic subset, defining a novel standard for spoken colloquialism that prioritizes "listenability" through natural vocabulary, linguistic fluency, and interactive rapport, rather than rigid written accuracy; and 3) Acoustic subset, covering explicit understanding, generation, and implicit dialogue to rigorously evaluate comprehensive paralinguistic capabilities within authentic real-world scenarios. Through evaluating five state-of-the-art models, WavBench offers critical insights into the intersection of complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity, guiding the evolution of robust spoken dialogue models. The benchmark dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://naruto-2024.github.io/wavbench.github.io/.

TL;DR: CitiLink-Minutes是一个包含120份欧洲葡萄牙语市政会议记录的多层标注数据集，填补了市政会议记录在信息检索和自然语言处理研究中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政会议记录作为地方治理的重要文件，对公民日常生活有直接影响，但由于缺乏标注数据集，限制了计算模型的发展。

Method: 收集了来自6个市政当局的120份会议记录，包含超过100万个词符，所有个人标识符均已去标识化。由两名训练有素的标注人员进行人工标注，并由经验丰富的语言学家进行校对，涵盖三个维度：元数据、讨论主题和投票结果，共计超过38,000个标注。

Result: 构建了一个符合FAIR原则的数据集，并提供了元数据提取、主题分类和投票标注的基线结果。

Conclusion: CitiLink-Minutes数据集为下游NLP和IR任务提供了重要资源，同时促进了市政决策的透明访问。

Abstract: City councils play a crucial role in local governance, directly influencing citizens' daily lives through decisions made during municipal meetings. These deliberations are formally documented in meeting minutes, which serve as official records of discussions, decisions, and voting outcomes. Despite their importance, municipal meeting records have received little attention in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), largely due to the lack of annotated datasets, which ultimately limit the development of computational models. To address this gap, we introduce CitiLink-Minutes, a multilayer dataset of 120 European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes from six municipalities. Unlike prior annotated datasets of parliamentary or video records, CitiLink-Minutes provides multilayer annotations and structured linkage of official written minutes. The dataset contains over one million tokens, with all personal identifiers de-identified. Each minute was manually annotated by two trained annotators and curated by an experienced linguist across three complementary dimensions: (1) metadata, (2) subjects of discussion, and (3) voting outcomes, totaling over 38,000 individual annotations. Released under FAIR principles and accompanied by baseline results on metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling, CitiLink-Minutes demonstrates its potential for downstream NLP and IR tasks, while promoting transparent access to municipal decisions.

*Sicheng Feng,Zigeng Chen,Xinyin Ma,Gongfan Fang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dVoting是一种基于扩散大语言模型的快速投票技术，无需训练即可提升推理能力，通过并行生成和迭代精炼不确定标记来显著提高数学推理和常识问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型在并行推理方面存在效率限制，而扩散大语言模型能够并行生成任意位置的标记。研究发现同一提示的多样本中大部分标记预测一致，但性能受少数可变标记影响，因此需要一种方法来识别和精炼这些关键标记。

Method: dVoting利用dLLMs的任意位置生成能力，通过采样、一致性分析识别不确定标记、投票重新生成这些标记的迭代精炼过程，直到收敛。整个过程无需额外训练，仅增加可接受的计算开销。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现显著提升：GSM8K提升6.22%-7.66%，MATH500提升4.40%-7.20%，ARC-C提升3.16%-14.84%，MMLU提升4.83%-5.74%。

Conclusion: dVoting成功展示了扩散大语言模型在并行推理方面的优势，通过投票机制有效提升了推理任务的性能，为未来大语言模型的发展提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) represent a new paradigm beyond autoregressive modeling, offering competitive performance while naturally enabling a flexible decoding process. Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks. It achieves gains of 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU. Our code is available at https://github.com/fscdc/dVoting

Motivation: 现有检索头分析基础上，寻求更有效的重排序方法，能够利用整个候选列表的全局信息，同时避免对Likert尺度监督的依赖。

Method: 训练模型使用选定注意力头的注意力分数来估计段落-查询相关性，提供列表式解决方案，支持小规模模型（如4B参数）实现高性能。

Result: 在多个领域（包括维基百科和长篇叙事数据集）上超越现有最先进的点式和列表式重排序方法，在LoCoMo基准测试中建立新的最先进性能，支持灵活扩展（如上下文信息增强和中间层注意力头训练）。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量高效，仅需小规模模型即可实现强大性能，支持灵活扩展，为检索重排序任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Built upon the existing analysis of retrieval heads in large language models, we propose an alternative reranking framework that trains models to estimate passage-query relevance using the attention scores of selected heads. This approach provides a listwise solution that leverages holistic information within the entire candidate shortlist during ranking. At the same time, it naturally produces continuous relevance scores, enabling training on arbitrary retrieval datasets without requiring Likert-scale supervision. Our framework is lightweight and effective, requiring only small-scale models (e.g., 4B parameters) to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art pointwise and listwise rerankers across multiple domains, including Wikipedia and long narrative datasets. It further establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo benchmark that assesses the capabilities of dialogue understanding and memory usage. We further demonstrate that our framework supports flexible extensions. For example, augmenting candidate passages with contextual information further improves ranking accuracy, while training attention heads from middle layers enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Motivation: AI模型在文本推理方面表现出色，但在空间和关系结构推理方面存在瓶颈，特别是在依赖视觉的早期数学教育中。需要评估MLLMs在真实课堂视觉问题上的能力。

Method: 构建基于赞比亚和印度小学考试的701个问题数据集，包含类比推理、模式完成和空间匹配等任务，使用未编辑的极简文本图像来测试模型。

Result: 发现模型能力存在"锯齿状边界"：在计数和缩放等静态技能上表现较好，但在折叠、反射和旋转等动态操作上达到明显的"空间天花板"。

Conclusion: 教育导向的基准测试如VRB对于确定课堂用多模态工具的功能边界至关重要，模型的空间推理弱点可能导致错误评分、虚假支架和强化学生错误概念。

Abstract: AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.

Abstract: Enterprise documents, such as forms and reports, embed critical information for downstream applications like data archiving, automated workflows, and analytics. Although generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on established document understanding benchmarks, their ability to conduct holistic, fine-grained structured extraction across diverse document types and flexible schemas is not well studied. Existing Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets are limited by narrow entity ontologies, simple queries, or homogeneous document types, often overlooking the need for adaptable and structured extraction. To address these gaps, we introduce ExStrucTiny, a new benchmark dataset for structured Information Extraction (IE) from document images, unifying aspects of KEE, RE, and VQA. Built through a novel pipeline combining manual and synthetic human-validated samples, ExStrucTiny covers more varied document types and extraction scenarios. We analyze open and closed VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting challenges such as schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization. We hope our work provides a bedrock for improving generalist models for structured IE in documents.

Result: 在HotpotQA、SQuADv2和TriviaQA数据集上，轻量级探测分类器平均达到0.72 AUC-ROC的溢出检测性能，证明结合查询信息能显著提升检测效果。

Conclusion: 从查询无关诊断发展到查询感知检测器，实现了低成本的预LLM门控机制，有效缓解压缩引起的错误。

Abstract: Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define \emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.

TL;DR: Moonshine v2是一个流式语音识别模型，采用滑动窗口自注意力机制，在保持高精度的同时实现了有界的低延迟推理，在边缘设备上达到与更大模型相当的准确率但显著降低延迟和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决延迟关键型语音应用在资源受限边缘设备上对低首次令牌时间(TTFT)和高转录精度的需求，特别是传统全注意力Transformer编码器因二次复杂度导致的线性增长延迟问题。

Method: 引入滑动窗口自注意力机制，替代传统的全注意力机制，通过限制注意力范围到局部窗口来实现有界计算复杂度和低延迟，同时保持强局部上下文建模能力。

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的词错误率，达到与6倍大小模型相当的准确率，同时运行速度显著更快，证明了局部注意力在精度上可与全注意力竞争。

Conclusion: 精心设计的局部注意力机制能以极小的尺寸和延迟成本实现与全注意力相当的准确性，为边缘设备上的交互式语音界面开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent "encode-the-whole-utterance" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

Abstract: This paper presents a technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) in the language and translation (L&T) industry. The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.g., in the form of lecturer support - in order to enable optimal learning conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.

Abstract: Context distillation enables language models to internalize in-context knowledge into their parameters. In our work, we propose On-Policy Context Distillation (OPCD), a framework that bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation by training a student model on its own generated trajectories while minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities. We further show that OPCD enables effective cross-size distillation, where smaller student models can internalize experiential knowledge from larger teachers.
